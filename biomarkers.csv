creatinine,Creatinine,"Creatinine is a chemical waste molecule that is generated from normal muscle break down. Sportspeople can therefore have higher levels than the average person.  Creatinine is cleared from the kidneys and so is also an accurate marker of kidney function, and may help in diagnosing kidney disease.",Kidney Health
urea,Urea,"Urea is a waste product produced by the body when it breaks down proteins in the liver. Once the urea is made, it is transported to the kidneys, which filter it out of the blood and remove it from the body in the form of urine. Measuring the levels of urea in the blood can therefore reflect how well both the liver and the kidneys, are functioning. It is important to note that even if one kidney is severely damaged but the other is functioning perfectly, results may still return as normal.",Kidney Health
egfr,eGFR,"The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) assesses how well the kidneys are working by estimating the amount of blood filtered through the kidneys. The glomeruli are tiny filters in the kidneys responsible for removing waste products. If these filters do not do their job properly, kidney function can be impaired. The eGFR calculation is an estimate of actual glomerular filtration rate, calculated using your age, gender, ethnicity, and serum creatinine levels.",Kidney Health
creatinine-urine,Creatinine - Urine,"Creatinine is a chemical waste molecule that is generated from normal muscle metabolism. Measurement of this is an indicator of the levels of other waste products in the body. Creatinine is also an accurate marker of kidney function, and may help in diagnosing kidney disease.",Kidney Health
microalbumin-urine,Microalbumin - Urine,"Albumin is one of the commonest proteins in the blood and is usually either not present, or present at extremely low levels in the urine. Increases in the quantity of albumin in the urine can be an early indicator of chronic kidney disease. 

This test measures the concentration of albumin in the urine. It is reported without a reference range as it can be affected by levels of hydration. It is used to calculate the albumin : creatinine ratio which takes account of changes in hydration levels.",Kidney Health
sodium,Sodium,"We do not report on sodium levels in fingerprick samples. This is because there is a small chance of a lower than expected result.

Sodium is both an electrolyte and a mineral. It helps to regulate the water and electrolyte balance of the body, and is therefore an important factor in blood pressure and pH. It also plays an important role in the function of nerves and muscles. Sodium levels in the blood are regulated by the kidneys.",Kidney Health
protein,Protein,"Protein can temporarily appear in the urine when there is infection or inflammation in the urinary tract. If it persists it can be a sign of underlying illness causing the kidneys to leak protein. 

This test uses a urine dipstick to provide an estimate of the amount of protein present in a urine sample.",Kidney Health
alt,ALT,"Alanine transferase (ALT) is an enzyme which is produced by the liver and can indicate liver damage caused by alcohol, drugs or viruses (hepatitis).",Liver Health
alp,ALP,"Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme found mainly in the liver and bones. Measuring it can indicate whether people have any ongoing liver, gallbladder or bone diseases.",Liver Health
hyaluronic-acid,Hyaluronic Acid,Hyaluronic acid is naturally present in virtually every tissue in the body but is found in high concentrations in the fluids of the eyes and joints. Hyaluronic Acid is also associated with liver function and liver fibrosis.,Liver Health
bilirubin,Bilirubin,"Bilirubin is a product of the breakdown of haemoglobin from red blood cells. It is removed from the body via the liver, stored and concentrated in the gallbladder and secreted into the bowel. It is removed from your body through urine and faeces. Bilirubin causes the yellowish colour you sometimes see in bruises, due to red blood cells breaking down underneath the skin.",Liver Health
total-bile-acids,Total Bile Acids,NA,Liver Health
conjugated-bilirubin,Conjugated Bilirubin,"Bilirubin is a product of haemoglobin breakdown, which is a protein in red blood cells. It is removed from the body via the liver, stored and concentrated in the gallbladder and secreted into the bowel. In the liver, most of the bilirubin is chemically attached to another molecule before it is released in the bile. This attached bilirubin is called conjugated or direct bilirubin.",Liver Health
shbg,SHBG,"Most of the sex hormones - testosterone, oestrogen and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) - found in your blood are bound to Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG) which means that they are unavailable to your cells. Measuring the level of SHBG in your blood gives important information about your levels of free or unbound hormones which are biologically active and available for use.",Proteins
albumin,Albumin,"Albumin is a protein which is made mainly in the liver. It helps to exert the osmotic pressure which holds water within the blood. It also helps carry nutrients and medications and other substances through the blood and is important for tissue growth and healing. Albumin also carries hormones around the body, therefore measuring the amount of albumin in the blood can help us calculate how much hormone is available to your tissues.",Proteins
globulin,Globulin,"Globulin is an umbrella term for a set of different proteins that the immune system and the liver produce. Certain globulins bind with haemoglobin while others transport metals, such as iron, in the blood. Additionally, there is a certain type of globulin known as an immunoglobulin, (another name for an antibody) which helps to fight infection in the body.",Proteins
total-protein,Total Protein,"Total Protein represents the sum of the proteins albumin and globulin in your blood. Albumin and globulin have a range of functions including keeping blood within vessels, transporting nutrients and fighting infection. Abnormal levels can indicate malnutrition as well as a liver or kidney disorder.",Proteins
igf-bp-3,IGF BP-3,NA,Proteins
triglycerides,Triglycerides,"Triglycerides are a type of fat (lipid) that circulate in the blood. They are carried in the bloodstream by lipoproteins called chylomicrons and VLDLs (very low density lipoproteins). After you eat, your body converts excess calories into triglycerides which are then transported to cells to be stored as fat. Your body then releases triglycerides when required for energy.",Cholesterol Status
ldl-cholesterol,LDL Cholesterol,"LDL cholesterol (low density lipoprotein) is a molecule made of lipids and proteins which transports cholesterol, triglycerides and other fats to various tissues throughout the body. Too much LDL cholesterol, commonly called 'bad cholesterol', can cause fatty deposits to accumulate inside artery walls, potentially leading to atherosclerosis and heart disease.


You can make dramatic changes to your cholesterol levels through diet and training. And just like with the diabetes checks, if you can improve your levels you can hopefully prevent getting serious, possibly even fatal conditions down the line. 

You can use HDL and LDL (and non-HDL) results as markers and targets for improvement. Regular exercise will help get the LDL down and the HDL up, in particular cardio and resistance training exercises. A Mediterranean diet which is high in vegetables and oily fish, and low in meat and dairy, will also help to optimise cholesterol levels.",Cholesterol Status
total-cholesterol-hdl,Total Cholesterol : HDL,"The cholesterol/HDL ratio is calculated by dividing your total cholesterol value by your HDL cholesterol level. It is used as a measure of cardiovascular risk because it gives a good insight into the proportion of your total cholesterol which is ""good"" (i.e. high-density lipoprotein, HDL). Heart disease risk tools (such as QRisk) use the cholesterol/HDL ratio to calculate your risk of having a heart attack.",Cholesterol Status
non-hdl-cholesterol,Non HDL Cholesterol,"Non-HDL cholesterol includes all the cholesterol molecules which are not HDL (or ‘good’ cholesterol). It therefore includes all the non-protective and potentially harmful cholesterol in your blood. As such, it is considered to be a better marker for cardiovascular risk than total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. The recommended level of non-HDL cholesterol is below 4 mmol/L.

apolipoprotein-a1,Apolipoprotein A1,"Apolipoprotein A1, or ApoA1 is a major protein that is a component of high-density lipoprotein, or HDL cholesterol. It helps clear cholesterol from the blood by removing cholesterol from organs and tissues to be destroyed by the liver.",Cholesterol Status
apolipoprotein-b,Apolipoprotein B,"Apolipoprotein B, or ApoB is the primary apolipoprotein of low-density lipoproteins (LDL or bad cholesterol). It is responsible for carrying cholesterol to tissues.",Cholesterol Status
lp-pla2,Lp PLA2,"The enzyme lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) plays a role in the inflammation of blood vessels, promoting the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries. Lp-PLA2 is a risk marker for cardiovascular disease and because it is produced in the plaque itself, Lp-PLA2 is thought to be more sensitive at assessing cardiovascular disease risk than traditional inflammatory markers, such as CRP.",Cholesterol Status
vldl-cholesterol,VLDL Cholesterol,NA,Cholesterol Status
total-cholesterol,Total Cholesterol,"Cholesterol is an essential fat (lipid) in the body. Although it has a bad reputation it has some important functions, including building cell membranes and producing a number of essential hormones. Cholesterol is manufactured in the liver and also comes from the food we eat. Total cholesterol is a measure of all the cholesterol in your blood, both good (HDL) and bad (LDL, VLDL and non HDL). 

Fats are the primary energy source for endurance events or when carbohydrate energy sources are low. In particular medium-chain fatty acids are heavily utilised. Cholesterol transports fatty acids around the body and by looking at the levels of the different types of cholesterol we can get an insight into your health and cardiovascular risk (i.e. the buildup of cholesterol in blood vessels leading to blood vessel narrowing, heart attack and stroke).

The liver regulates cholesterol levels in the body; it both synthesizes it and removes it, it also synthesises various lipoproteins that transport cholesterol throughout the body – and it is these that we measure in the cholesterol test.",Cholesterol Status
ldl-7-subfractions,LDL - 7 Subfractions,"This test will report on the levels of LDL types 1 and 2 which are the larger LDL particles, and LDL types 3 through 7 which are the smaller denser particles that are more strongly associated with atheroma formation.",Cholesterol Status
crp,CRP,C Reactive Protein (CRP) is a protein made in the liver in response to inflammation or infection in the body.,Inflammation
esr,ESR,"ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) is a non-specific inflammation marker. It measures the rate at which red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube. The blood cells fall quicker during inflammation, as there are more proteins in the blood, caused by the inflammation. It is said to be nonspecific because increases do not indicate exactly where the inflammation in your body is, or what is causing it, and also because it can be affected by other conditions other than inflammation.",Inflammation
ferritin,Ferritin,"Ferritin is a complex globular protein which stores iron in an inactive form. As your iron stores deplete, the ferritin releases its iron for use. If your ferritin depletes then you will run out of iron and if your iron runs out your ability to produce red blood cells in your bone marrow decreases. Ferritin therefore gives a good measure of your iron stores.

Ferritin is also an acute phase protein, so can increase during periods of infection, inflammation or trauma.",Iron Status
iron,Iron,"Iron is a vital component of oxygen transport, DNA synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation, which are fundamental processes for life, let alone sporting performance. About half of your body’s iron (about 2.1g) is found in red blood cells in the oxygen-transporting haemoglobin. About another gram is found in macrophages (white blood cells) and in the oxygen-transporting myoglobin of muscles. Excess iron is stored in the liver. If you are low on iron you will struggle to respire at the cellular level as well as you could and so you will feel more fatigued and get tired quicker. For athletes this will result in a reduced performance, impaired VO2 Max, reduced energy efficiency, inability to train maximally each day, greater maximum lactate and quicker exhaustion.  

You get your iron from two main sources: from your diet (about 5%) and from the breakdown and turnover of your red blood cells (about 95%). In your diet there are two main types of iron: Fe2+, which is found in meat and dairy products, and Fe3+, which is harder to absorb and found in plant based foods. 

Iron status tests look at several measures of iron, which together can paint a picture about your iron metabolism and what it means for you.",Iron Status
tibc,TIBC,Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) is a measure of the ability of your body to efficiently carry iron through the blood.,Iron Status
uibc,UIBC,Unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) represents the portion of iron binding sites on transferrin that are not occupied by iron. UIBC is often measured along with iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) as a diagnostic tool to determine various iron disorders.,Iron Status
oestradiol,Oestradiol,"Oestradiol is a female steroid hormone, produced in the ovaries of women and to a much lesser extent in the testes of men. It is the strongest of three oestrogens and is responsible for the female reproductive system as well as the growth of breast tissue and bone thickness. In pre-menopausal women, oestradiol levels vary throughout the monthly cycle, peaking at ovulation. In women, oestradiol levels decline with age, culminating with the menopause when the ovaries stop producing eggs. Low oestradiol can cause many symptoms associated with the menopause, including hot flushes, night sweats and mood swings. Low oestradiol can also cause osteoporosis.",Hormones
progesterone,Progesterone,"Progesterone is a steroid hormone produced in the corpus luteum and the adrenal glands. Its main role is to prepare the body for and support a pregnancy. It is produced in increasing amounts in the second half of the menstrual cycle. Progesterone is normally tested on day 21 of your menstrual cycle to assess whether ovulation has taken place. 

Although progesterone is considered a female hormone, men also produce progesterone in the adrenal glands and the testes. Progesterone in men plays a role in testosterone production.",Hormones
testosterone,Testosterone,"Testosterone is a hormone that causes male characteristics. For men, it helps to regulate sex drive and has a role in controlling bone mass, fat distribution, muscle mass, strength and the production of red blood cells and sperm. Testosterone is produced in the testicles of men and, in much smaller amounts, in the ovaries of women. Testosterone levels in men naturally decline after the age of 30, although lower than normal levels can occur at any age and can cause low libido, erectile dysfunction, difficulty in gaining and maintaining muscle mass and lack of energy. Although women have much lower amounts of testosterone than men, it is important for much the same reasons, playing a role in libido, the distribution of muscle and fat and the formation of red blood cells. All laboratories will slightly differ in the reference ranges they apply because they are based on the population they are testing. The normal range is set so that 95% of men will fall into it. For greater consistency, we use the guidance from the British Society for Sexual Medicine (BSSM) which advises that low testosterone can be diagnosed when testosterone is consistently below the reference range, and that levels below 12 nmol/L could also be considered low, especially in men who also report symptoms of low testosterone or who have low levels of free testosterone.",Hormones
free-testosterone-calc,Free Testosterone - Calc.,"Most testosterone circulating in the blood is bound to proteins, in particular SHBG and albumin; only 2-3 % of testosterone is free and available to cells. This test uses an algorithm to calculate the level of free or unbound testosterone in relation to total testosterone, SHBG and albumin.",Hormones
fsh,FSH,"Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is produced in the pituitary gland and is important for women in the production of eggs by the ovaries and for men for men in the production of sperm. 

In the first half of the menstrual cycle in women, FSH stimulates the enlargement of follicles within the ovaries. Each of these follicles will help to increase oestradiol levels. One follicle will become dominant and will be released by the ovary (ovulation), after which follicle stimulating hormone levels drop during the second half of the menstrual cycle.

In men, FSH acts on the seminiferous tubules of the testicles where they stimulate immature sperm cells to develop into mature sperm.",Hormones
lh,LH,"Luteinising Hormone (LH) is produced by the pituitary gland and is important for male and female fertility. In women it governs the menstrual cycle, peaking before ovulation. In men it stimulates the production of testosterone.",Hormones
prolactin,Prolactin,"Prolactin is a hormone which is produced in the pituitary gland and plays a role in reproductive health. Its primary purpose is to stimulate milk production after childbirth, and in pregnant and breastfeeding women prolactin levels can soar.",Hormones
free-androgen-index,Free Androgen Index,"The free androgen index (FAI) is a calculation used to determine the amount of testosterone which is free (unbound) in the bloodstream. Most testosterone is bound to proteins sex hormone binding globulin and albumin and is not available to interact with the body's cells. The FAI is a calculation based on the ratio of testosterone and SHBG and is a measure of the amount of testosterone that is available to act on the body's tissues. 

The free androgen index is used in women to assess the likelihood of polycystic ovarian syndrome. In men, free testosterone gives a better indication of testosterone status.",Hormones
androstenedione,Androstenedione,"Androstenedione is a steroid hormone that occurs naturally in the body, responsible for male characteristics. Androstenedione is a metabolite of DHEA and is a direct precursor to the male hormone testosterone.",Hormones
dihydrotestosterone,Dihydrotestosterone,"Dihydrotestosterone is made from testosterone in several areas of the body (prostate, hair follicles, liver, brain, and parts of the testicles). It has a more powerful effect within the body than testosterone. Dihydrotestosterone is responsible for triggering the growth of facial hair, and higher levels are associated with male pattern baldness.",Hormones
oestrone,Oestrone,NA,Hormones
growth-hormone,Growth Hormone,"Growth hormone (hGH), or somatotropin, is a hormone responsible for normal body growth and development. Growth hormone also plays a role in regulating muscle mass, bone density and lipid metabolism.",Hormones
leptin,Leptin,NA,Hormones
pregnenolone,Pregnenolone,"Pregnenolone is a chemical that is a precursor to all steroid hormones in the body. For normal steroid hormone production, cholesterol is converted into pregnenolone in the adrenal glands and then several enzymes complete the production of multiple hormones. A Pregnenolone test helps to monitor and/or rule out two of the more rare forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).",Hormones
beta-hcg,Beta HCG,HCG is a pregnancy hormone produced by the placenta when a fertilised egg implants in the uterine wall. The hormone hCG starts to be produced around six days after fertilisation and can usually be detected 10 days after a missed menstrual period.,Hormones
testosterone-cortisol,Testosterone : Cortisol,"The Testosterone/Cortisol (T:C) ratio is a marker which shows promise in assessing whether athletes are recovering well after intense training. Testosterone is an anabolic hormone which helps to build muscle, produce red blood cells and increase aerobic metabolism in muscles. Cortisol is a catabolic hormone working antagonistically with testosterone, inhibiting protein synthesis and blocking anabolic signalling. The T:C ratio is more sensitive to the stresses of training than either measure alone. Over time it can be trended to see how well you are recovering.",Hormones
estriol,Estriol,NA,Hormones
intact-pth,Intact PTH,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is important in controlling blood calcium levels. When calcium levels are low, the parathyroid gland releases PTH into the bloodstream. PTH is able to retrieve calcium from bone, stimulate vitamin D activation in the kidneys and suppress calcium excretion in the urine.",Hormones
free-t3,Free T3,"Triiodothyronine (T3) is the more active of the two thyroid hormones produced by the thyroid gland. Most T3 is bound to protein in the blood. Free T3 measures the level of T3 that is free, or unbound to protein, and is available to regulate metabolism.",Thyroid Hormones
free-thyroxine,Free Thyroxine,"Thyroxine (T4) is one of two hormones produced by the thyroid gland. It works to speed up the rate of your metabolism. Most T4 is bound to carrier proteins in the blood, but it is only the free, or unbound T4 that is active in the body, which is measured in this test.",Thyroid Hormones
tsh,TSH,"The thyroid is a gland at the base of your neck responsible for a number of metabolic processes, including energy expenditure, cardiac function, muscle physiology and substrate turnover. Disturbances in your thyroid function can lead to excess hormone levels (overactive) or diminished levels (underactive), both of which can lead to a decrease in athletic performance.

Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is produced by the pituitary gland and stimulates the thyroid gland to produce the two thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3).

Thyroid hormone production is part of a neuroendocrine cascade. It starts in the hypothalamus with the release of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), which triggers the pituitary gland to produce thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). This binds to cells in the thyroid gland to release the hormones T3 and T4 (thyroxine). T4 is also converted into T3 (the more active thyroid hormone) at peripheral tissues. It is these hormones which essentially control the metabolism around your body. All these levels are normally held in tight balance through negative feedback loops. 

Abnormal thyroid function can manifest by over-secretion or under-secreting the thyroid hormones. Very often there is an autoimmune component to these conditions and we can often see this by looking at your thyroid antibodies in more advanced thyroid tests.",Thyroid Hormones
hba1c,HbA1c,"Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), also known as glycated haemoglobin, is a longer term measure of glucose levels in your blood than a simple blood glucose test. Glucose attaches itself to the haemoglobin in your red blood cells, and as your cells live for around 12-16 weeks, it gives us a good indication of the average level of sugar in your blood over a 3 month period.",Diabetes
insulin,Insulin,"Insulin is an important metabolic hormone. Made in your pancreas, insulin is produced after eating in order to move the sugar from your blood into your cells for future energy use. If we eat too much, especially sugar and starchy foods, our bodies are flooded with insulin and over time our cells become resistant to the effects of insulin, leaving high levels of sugar and insulin in the bloodstream.",Diabetes
insulin-fasting,Insulin - Fasting,NA,Diabetes
fasting-insulin-resistance-index,Fasting Insulin Resistance Index,NA,Diabetes
fructosamine,Fructosamine,"Fructosamine is a marker of sugar control in the body reflecting the average sugar level in the blood over the previous 2–3 weeks. It is the best way for people with haemoglobin problems to check how well their body has been controlling their glucose levels over the past few weeks. This is because conditions such as sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia can cause a lower than expected HbA1c result.

When glucose levels are raised in the blood over a period of time, glucose molecules permanently combine with proteins in the blood. These combined molecules remain for the life of the protein and provide a record of the average amount of glucose present in the blood over that time period.

The fructosamine test reflects the average glucose levels over a 2 to 3 week time period as serum proteins have a lifespan, of around 14 to 21 days.",Diabetes
glucose,Glucose ,"This test looks for the presence of glucose in your urine. Glucose is a type of sugar and the body's main source of energy. The hormone insulin helps to move glucose from the blood into the body’s cells. If there is too much glucose in the blood, the extra glucose is eliminated through the urine. 

A urine glucose test is useful in determining if blood glucose levels are too high, which may be a sign of diabetes.",Diabetes
glucose-random,Glucose - Random,"The random blood glucose test measures the level of sugar in your blood and is an indicator of how well your body is metabolising sugars to store in your cells. It is most useful when analysed in conjunction with other sugar markers, such as HbA1c.",Diabetes

intrinsic-factor-antibodies,Intrinsic Factor Antibodies,"Intrinsic factor is produced in the stomach and helps extract vitamin B12 from the foods we eat. Interference in its production or activity can reduce the absorption of vitamin B12. Intrinsic factor antibodies are produced by the immune system. Intrinsic factor is necessary to extract vitamin B12 from the food we eat. Without sufficient intrinsic factor available, vitamin B12 is unabsorbed and the body cannot produce enough red blood cells which leads to the autoimmune condition pernicious anaemia.",Autoimmunity
thyroglobulin-antibodies,Thyroglobulin Antibodies,"This test looks for antibodies to thyroglobulin, a protein which is specific to the thyroid gland. Under normal circumstances it does not enter the bloodstream, but if your thyroid is inflamed or under attack from the body's own immune system, then thyroglobulin can be secreted and antibodies detected.

Most cases of thyroid disease are caused by an autoimmune condition where the thyroid gland is attacked by the body's own immune system. This can cause the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormone (as in the case of Graves' disease) or to produce less as the cells in the thyroid gland are gradually destroyed (as in the case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis).",Autoimmunity

Deficiency in magnesium can cause muscle weakness, muscle spasms, altered creatine kinase and an altered lactate response to exercise.

Athletes are prone to low magnesium levels and should look to monitor their magnesium at regular intervals. You should ensure you have a magnesium rich meal. The use of supplements as a performance aid and to address deficiency has been looked into a lot over the years. The current research is still inconclusive and actually some people who take magnesium supplements see their magnesium levels depleted quicker than normal. Therefore it appears, for now at least, that the best way to get the magnesium you need is through a magnesium rich diet.",Minerals

Cortisol is produced in the adrenal gland and works on the majority of cells in your body. It can help to control blood sugar levels, blood pressure, regulate metabolism, reduce inflammation and assists with memory.

High performance athletes are constantly facing mentally and physically stressful situations and so may produce more cortisol than the average person, however to confuse matters, athletes who overtrain or over-reach may produce less cortisol. A large review of all the evidence didn't find any obvious trends for optimisation, however we do know that if your cortisol levels are too high or too low then you will not perform to the peak of your ability and it will be important to find the underlying cause for the deranged levels.

hepatitis-c-antibodies,Hepatitis C Antibodies,"This test measures antibodies against hepatitis C in your blood which will tell you whether you have ever been infected with hepatitis C. Different laboratories will report results in different ways. If antibodies are reported as “detected”, “positive” or “reactive” then your result shows that you have been infected with hepatitis C. This test will not tell you whether your infection is still active so a positive test will need to be followed up with a test for a current infection. If your result is reported as “not detected”, “negative” or “non-reactive”, this means that you have not been infected by hepatitis C.  If you have not allowed enough time from your potential exposure to hepatitis C and your test, there may not have been sufficient time for antibodies to develop. This means that there is a risk that your test will return a “false negative”. If you believe that you are at risk of a hepatitis C infection you are advised to repeat the test again in 6 months.

Hepatitis C is a viral infection that can cause inflammation and scarring of the liver. If it is left untreated over many years, it can cause irreparable liver damage. About 20% of infected people clear the virus by themselves and, if treated, most people recover well from a hepatitis C infection. 

Hepatitis C is normally transmitted by blood to blood contact. The most common cause of a hepatitis C infection is from shared needles, but it can also be transmitted from a mother to her unborn baby, and (less commonly) through unprotected sex. Health care workers or people who may come into contact with other people’s blood through their work may be required to check for hepatitis C.

In most of the population, a result greater than 10 IU/L means that you have sufficient antibodies for immunity. A result less than 10 IU/L means that you are not immune. 
If you are prone to exposure to hepatitis B through your work (Exposure Prone Procedures – EPP), then you will require a result greater than 100 IU/L to confirm immunity. 

If your result shows that you have immunity to hepatitis B it means that you are both protected from possible infection and will not pass it on to another person. You can acquire hep B immunity through prior vaccination(s), or by having recovered from a previous infection.  This test will not tell you whether you are currently infected with hepatitis B. 

Hepatitis B is an infectious viral disease which causes your liver to become inflamed and enlarged. Most people recover from an acute hepatitis B infection by themselves within around 6 months. However, for others, the infection becomes chronic (prolonged) which can lead to lasting liver damage. Hepatitis B can have few symptoms, especially in the early stages. 

People who are at risk of becoming infected with hepatitis B are those who have had close contact with others who are infected (including unprotected sexual contact). Coming into contact with infected blood (e.g. through sharing needles, some contact sports) will also put you at risk of becoming infected with hepatitis B.
