creatinine,Creatinine,"<h3>About</h3><p>Creatinine is a chemical waste molecule that is generated from normal muscle metabolism. Measurement of this is an indicator of the levels of other waste products in the body. Creatinine is also an accurate marker of kidney function, and may help in diagnosing kidney disease.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low creatinine can be found in individuals with a low protein diet or reduced muscle mass.</p>
<p>It may also simply indicate that the kidneys are functioning efficiently.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated creatinine can suggest that the kidneys are not functioning properly, and so are not excreting sufficient amounts of creatinine. This may occur in conditions such as glomerulonephritis or bacterial kidney infections. Additionally, dehydration and atherosclerosis can reduce the blood flow to the kidneys and cause this to happen.</p>
<p>For most people the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will give a better estimate of kidney function.</p>
<p>Elevated levels may also be found in individuals taking creatinine supplements and engaging in vigorous exercise.</p>",Kidney Health
urea,Urea,"<h3>About</h3><p>Urea is a waste product produced by the body when it breaks down proteins in the liver. Once the urea is made, it is transported to the kidneys, which filter it out of the blood and remove it from the body in the form of urine. Measuring the levels of urea in the blood can therefore reflect how well both the liver and the kidneys, are functioning. It is important to note that even if one kidney is severely damaged but the other is functioning perfectly, results may still return as normal.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A low result may simply mean that you are overhydrated or are not consuming enough protein. Low levels of urea in the blood can also indicate liver disease which could prevent the body from making urea.</p>
<p>Low levels of urea can also be common in the blood of pregnant women.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated urea can simply mean that you are dehydrated but can also suggest the presence of a kidney disease. When the kidneys are not functioning adequately, they are unable to filter enough urea out of the blood and into the urine, leading to raised levels of urea in the blood. This can occur in chronic kidney disease.</p>
<p>Raised levels of urea can also arise if the kidneys are not supplied with sufficient blood. Conditions limiting kidney blood supply include gastrointestinal bleeds and congestive heart failure.</p>",Kidney Health
egfr,eGFR,"<h3>About</h3><p>The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) assesses how well the kidneys are working by estimating the amount of blood filtered through the kidneys. The glomeruli are tiny filters in the kidneys responsible for removing waste products. If these filters do not do their job properly, kidney function can be impaired. The eGFR calculation is an estimate of actual glomerular filtration rate, calculated using your age, gender, ethnicity, and serum creatinine levels.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A low eGFR result can indicate your kidneys are not working as well as they should. eGFR can be used to assess the severity of chronic kidney disease (CKD).</p>
<p>It is important to note that individuals with high muscle mass as well as people of certain ethnicities can have a low eGFR which is normal for them. Temporary decreases in eGFR can occur when someone is dehydrated, so a repeat test is often recommended.</p>",Kidney Health

creatinine-urine,Creatinine - Urine,"<h3>About</h3><p>Creatinine is a chemical waste molecule that is generated from normal muscle metabolism. Measurement of this is an indicator of the levels of other waste products in the body. Creatinine is also an accurate marker of kidney function, and may help in diagnosing kidney disease.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low creatinine can be found in individuals with a low protein diet or reduced muscle mass.</p>

microalbumin-urine,Microalbumin - Urine,"<h3>About</h3><p>Albumin is one of the commonest proteins in the blood and is usually either not present, or present at extremely low levels in the urine. Increases in the quantity of albumin in the urine can be an early indicator of chronic kidney disease. </p>
<p>This test measures the concentration of albumin in the urine. It is reported without a reference range as it can be affected by levels of hydration. It is used to calculate the albumin : creatinine ratio which takes account of changes in hydration levels.</p>",Kidney Health
microalbumin-creatinine,Microalbumin : Creatinine,"<h3>About</h3><p>Albumin is one of the commonest proteins in the blood and is usually either not present, or present at extremely low levels in the urine. Increases in the quantity of albumin in the urine can be an early indicator of chronic kidney disease. This measurement is of most use in monitoring for damage caused to the kidneys by diabetes, and in monitoring the progress of chronic kidney disease.</p>
<p>This test measures the ratio of albumin to creatinine in the urine. This corrects for the effects of hydration on albumin concentration.</p>",Kidney Health
sodium,Sodium,"<h3>About</h3><p>We do not report on sodium levels in fingerprick samples. This is because there is a small chance of a lower than expected result.</p>
<p>Sodium is both an electrolyte and a mineral. It helps to regulate the water and electrolyte balance of the body, and is therefore an important factor in blood pressure and pH. It also plays an important role in the function of nerves and muscles. Sodium levels in the blood are regulated by the kidneys.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Too little sodium is often caused by fluid retention (oedema) or reflects loss due to vomiting, diarrhoea or excessive sweating.</p>
<p>Low levels of sodium can also be caused by a reduction in hormones such as aldosterone, which normally act to increase sodium levels in the blood. A condition in which insufficient aldosterone is produced is Addison's disease, where the adrenal glands are not functioning efficiently.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of sodium in the blood is usually due to dehydration. This is because a reduced amount of water in the body makes blood and fluids far too concentrated with sodium.</p>
<p>Raised levels of sodium in the blood can also indicate that the kidneys are not working properly.</p>",Kidney Health
protein,Protein,"<h3>About</h3><p>Protein can temporarily appear in the urine when there is infection or inflammation in the urinary tract. If it persists it can be a sign of underlying illness causing the kidneys to leak protein. </p>
<p>This test uses a urine dipstick to provide an estimate of the amount of protein present in a urine sample.</p>",Kidney Health

alt,ALT,"<h3>About</h3><p>Alanine transferase (ALT) is an enzyme which is mostly found in the liver, but is also found in smaller amounts in the heart, muscles and the kidneys. If the liver is damaged, ALT is leaked into to bloodstream. As ALT is predominantly found in the liver, it is usually an accurate marker for liver inflammation and can indicate liver damage caused by alcohol, fatty liver, drugs or viruses (hepatitis).</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Having low levels of ALT in your blood is completely normal.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Raised levels may indicate that your muscles are damaged for example after intensive exercise. However, this more commonly suggests that the liver is inflamed or damaged with diseases such as hepatitis, cirrhosis or fatty liver disease.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>An elevated ALT result (in combination with other raised liver enzymes) may signify fatty liver disease or fibrosis (where inflammation has progressed to cause stiffness and scarring of the liver). Fatty liver can be caused by drinking too much alcohol, or by fat accumulating in the liver, mainly due to being overweight or obese. It is associated with diabetes, raised blood pressure and high cholesterol. There is a lot you can do to keep your liver healthy: keep your alcohol consumption to the recommended 14 units a week or less and try to have a few alcohol-free days every week; losing weight, if you need to, is important, as is eating a healthy diet, high in whole grains and fibre and plenty of fruit and vegetables, and low in processed foods, sugar and unhealthy fats. </p>
<p>A raised ALT caused by any drugs or medication that you are taking is normally temporary and should go back to normal once you cease your medication.</p>",Liver Health
ggt,GGT,"<h3>About</h3><p>Gamma GT, also known as gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), is a liver enzyme which is raised in liver and bile duct diseases. It is used in conjunction with ALP to distinguish between bone or liver disease. Gamma GT is also used to diagnose alcohol abuse as it is raised in 75% of long term drinkers.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Both normal and low results indicate that it is very unlikely that you have liver disease.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of Gamma-GT can be caused by liver diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. This is because when the liver is damaged it can leak its contents, such as enzymes, into the bloodstream. Levels can also rise in people with bile duct blockages due to ailments such as gallstones and gallbladder tumours.</p>
<p>Levels of Gamma-GT are also raised due to alcohol abuse and is often a clear sign that alcohol intake needs to be reduced to prevent permanent liver damage.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>Improving your GGT depends on the reason for your elevated result. If excessive alcohol consumption is suspected, then the most important thing you can do is to moderate your drinking or stop altogether to enable your liver to recover. Your liver has amazing powers of regeneration, but if liver damage progresses, then scarring (cirrhosis) could occur which then becomes irreversible.</p>",Liver Health
alp,ALP,"<h3>About</h3><p>Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme found mainly in the liver and bones. Measuring it can indicate ongoing liver, gallbladder or bone disease.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Raised levels can indicate bone disease or liver disorders such as a blockage in the bile duct, cirrhosis as well as gallbladder issues. Elevated ALP is assessed in conjunction with other liver function tests to determine whether the problem lies in the liver or the bones.</p>
<p>Pregnancy can also cause raised ALP as it is also made in the placenta, and it is often elevated in growing teenagers. This is because bones are growing, and since a large amount of ALP can be found in bones, its circulating levels increase.</p>",Liver Health
hyaluronic-acid,Hyaluronic Acid,"<h3>About</h3><p>Hyaluronic acid is naturally present in virtually every tissue in the body but is found in high concentrations in the fluids of the eyes and joints. Hyaluronic Acid is also associated with liver function and liver fibrosis.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated hyaluronic acid levels in the blood can indicate liver fibrosis, as liver fibrosis affects the removal of hyaluronic acid and can cause a rise in hyaluronic acid levels.</p>",Liver Health
bilirubin,Bilirubin,"<h3>About</h3><p>Bilirubin is a product of the breakdown of haemoglobin from red blood cells. It is removed from the body via the liver, stored and concentrated in the gallbladder and secreted into the bowel. It is removed from your body through urine and faeces. Bilirubin causes the yellowish colour you sometimes see in bruises, due to red blood cells breaking down underneath the skin.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of bilirubin can cause the skin and whites of eyes to become yellow (jaundice), as bilirubin builds up around the body. This is most likely caused by the liver being unable to remove sufficient bilirubin from the blood. This can be caused by liver damage such as cirrhosis, or, more commonly, a harmless inherited disorder called Gilbert's syndrome.</p>",Liver Health
total-bile-acids,Total Bile Acids,,Liver Health
conjugated-bilirubin,Conjugated Bilirubin,"<h3>About</h3><p>Bilirubin is a product of haemoglobin breakdown, which is a protein in red blood cells. It is removed from the body via the liver, stored and concentrated in the gallbladder and secreted into the bowel. In the liver, most of the bilirubin is chemically attached to another molecule before it is released in the bile. This attached bilirubin is called conjugated or direct bilirubin.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of bilirubin can cause the skin and whites of eyes to become yellow (jaundice) as bilirubin builds up around the body. This is most likely caused by the liver being unable to remove sufficient bilirubin from the blood, and so an excessive amount begins to circulate around the body. This can be caused by liver damage such as cirrhosis, or an inherited disorder called Gilbert's syndrome.</p>
<p>Raised levels of bilirubin can also be found in individuals with a blocked bile duct, where disorders such as gallstones stop bilirubin from being excreted into the urine, causing it to build up in the blood.</p>",Liver Health

bilirubin-urine,Bilirubin - Urine,"<h3>About</h3><p>Bilirubin is a product of the breakdown of haemoglobin from red blood cells. It is removed from the body via the liver, stored and concentrated in the gallbladder and secreted into the bowel. It is removed from your body through urine and faeces. Bilirubin causes the yellowish colour you sometimes see in bruises, due to red blood cells breaking down underneath the skin.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of bilirubin can cause the skin and whites of eyes to become yellow (jaundice), as bilirubin builds up around the body.

shbg,SHBG,"<h3>About</h3><p>SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin) is a protein which transports the sex hormones (testosterone, oestrogen and dihydrotestosterone (DHT)) in the blood.  Hormones which are bound to SHBG are inactive which means that they are unavailable to your cells. Measuring the level of SHBG in your blood gives important information about your levels of free or unbound hormones which are biologically active and available for use.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of SHBG usually correlates with higher levels of free or unbound sex hormones. Low SHBG can be seen in people who are obese, have an underactive thyroid, have polycystic ovaries (and therefore higher levels of free androgens) and those with adrenal dysfunction. It can also be caused by the use of anabolic steroids.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>High level of SHBG means that more of your sex hormones are bound to SHBG and are therefore unavailable to your cells. This means that you can have symptoms of low testosterone for example, even though your total testosterone level is normal. Causes of elevated SHBG include liver disease, an overactive thyroid, an eating disorder such as anorexia nervosa or steroid treatment. Sometimes if can demonstrate a hormone irregularity and can also increase during pregnancy.</p>",Proteins
albumin,Albumin,"<h3>About</h3><p>Albumin is a protein which is made mainly in the liver. It helps to exert the osmotic pressure which holds water within the blood. It also helps carry nutrients and medications and other substances through the blood and is important for tissue growth and healing. Albumin also carries hormones around the body, therefore measuring the amount of albumin in the blood can help us calculate how much hormone is available to your tissues.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low albumin levels can indicate liver disease and can also be a marker for chronic ill-health, malnutrition and inflammation. Low levels can also occur in kidney conditions such as nephrotic syndrome as well as diabetes.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Raised levels are usually caused by dehydration, however elevated levels of albumin can also appear in malnutrition, inflammatory conditions, as well as kidney and heart conditions.</p>",Proteins
globulin,Globulin,"<h3>About</h3><p>Globulin is an umbrella term for a set of different proteins that the immune system and the liver produce. Certain globulins bind with haemoglobin while others transport metals, such as iron, in the blood. Additionally, there is a certain type of globulin known as an immunoglobulin, (another name for an antibody) which helps to fight infection in the body.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of globulin may be found in individuals with nephrosis (a condition in which the kidneys do not filter the protein from the blood and it leaks into the urine), acute haemolytic anaemia and liver disease.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of globulin may be found in individuals suffering from chronic infections (parasites, viral and bacterial), liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis and certain autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus and collagen diseases.</p>",Proteins
total-protein,Total Protein,"<h3>About</h3><p>Total Protein represents the sum of the proteins albumin and globulin in your blood. Albumin and globulin have a range of functions including keeping blood within vessels, transporting nutrients and fighting infection. Abnormal levels can indicate malnutrition as well as a liver or kidney disorder.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels can be found in individuals with liver diseases, when the liver is not producing sufficient protein, and in kidney diseases, where the kidneys allow too much protein to be passed out of the body in the urine.</p>
<p>Low levels can also indicate gastrointestinal disorders such as coeliac disease and Crohn's disease, in which insufficient amounts of proteins are absorbed.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of total protein are usually mild and transient and may indicate infections. This is due to an influx of proteins such as antibodies into the blood to help fight the infection.</p>
<p>Raised levels of total protein can also occasionally be found in medical conditions including certain bone marrow diseases such as Waldenstrom's disease and multiple myeloma, where the bone marrow produces excessive amounts of protein.</p>",Proteins

triglycerides,Triglycerides,"<h3>About</h3><p>Triglycerides are a type of fat (lipid) that circulate in the blood. After you eat, your body converts excess calories (whether from fat or carbohydrates) into triglycerides which are then transported to cells to be stored as fat. Your body then releases triglycerides when required for energy.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of triglycerides generally correlate with a low risk of heart disease and stroke.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>A common reason for elevated triglycerides is that you have recently eaten and your body is simply dealing with the calories you have just consumed. If this is the case, our doctors will advise you to repeat the test after you have fasted overnight - which will give a more meaningful picture of your triglyceride levels. (We don't normally ask you to fast for your cholesterol test because we can generally build a better picture of your cholesterol status from a non-fasting sample.)</p>
<p>Elevated levels of triglycerides can indicate a higher risk of heart disease and stroke, especially if other risk factors are present too. High triglycerides are often (but not always) seen in people who are overweight or obese, who have raised LDL cholesterol, who lead sedentary lifestyles or who have type 2 diabetes.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>You can aim to reduce your triglycerides by reducing the amount of saturated and trans fats you eat (trans fats are commonly found in ready meals and processed foods), lowering your calorie intake and, if you need to, losing weight. Reducing the amount of refined grains and sugar in your diet and increasing whole grains and fibre has also been shown to help. </p>
<p>Exercise, limiting alcohol consumption and stopping smoking, if relevant for you, can also help to improve triglyceride levels while at the same time reducing your risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>",Cholesterol Status
ldl-cholesterol,LDL Cholesterol,"<h3>About</h3><p>LDL cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein) is a molecule made of lipids and proteins which transports cholesterol, triglycerides and other fats to various tissues throughout the body. Too much LDL cholesterol, commonly called 'bad cholesterol', can cause fatty deposits to accumulate inside artery walls, potentially leading to atherosclerosis and heart disease.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Lower levels of LDL cholesterol are considered to be protective against heart disease as there is less cholesterol available to be deposited on artery walls.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of LDL cholesterol can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease, especially if combined with other risk factors such as elevated triglycerides, raised blood sugar and high blood pressure. If your body has more cholesterol than you need, LDL can deposit cholesterol and fats on artery walls, which can form plaques and obstruct blood flow.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>You may be able to lower your LDL cholesterol levels by making changes to your diet, especially by cutting down on saturated fats and increasing your intake of fruit, vegetables and whole grains. Animal foods containing high levels of saturated fats (including red meat and cheeses) can also contain high amounts of cholesterol. Unlike animal products, plants do not contain cholesterol so eating more fresh fruit and vegetables as well as seeds, nuts and whole grains in place of animal fats can help to lower cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>Exercising more and limiting alcohol consumption can also help to lower the risk of cholesterol-related diseases.</p>
<p>As only some of the cholesterol in the body comes from the food we eat, it may be difficult for some people, especially if they have inherited high cholesterol, to lower it through diet and lifestyle alone.</p>",Cholesterol Status
total-cholesterol-hdl,Total Cholesterol : HDL,"<h3>About</h3><p>The cholesterol/HDL ratio is calculated by dividing your total cholesterol value by your HDL cholesterol level. It is used as a measure of cardiovascular risk because it gives a good insight into the proportion of your total cholesterol which is &quot;good&quot; (i.e. high-density lipoprotein, HDL). Heart disease risk tools (such as QRisk) use the cholesterol/HDL ratio to calculate your risk of having a heart attack.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A low cholesterol/HDL ratio indicates a lower risk of cardiovascular disease because you have a high proportion of protective HDL cholesterol.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>A higher ratio may indicate a higher risk of heart disease. This is because more of your cholesterol is made up of  LDL cholesterol. Too much LDL cholesterol can leave damaging deposits on the walls of your blood vessels which can lead to a heart attack or stroke.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>You can aim to improve your cholesterol/HDL ratio by reducing your level of LDL cholesterol while at the same time increasing your level of healthy HDL cholesterol. Replace saturated animal fats with heart-healthy fats found in oily fish, nuts and seeds and aim to eat a diet high in whole grains, fresh fruit and vegetables as are found in the Mediterranean diet. Try to increase the amount of exercise you take, especially if you are sedentary as regular exercise has been shown to improve HDL cholesterol levels. If you are overweight, losing any excess weight may also help. </p>
<p>If lifestyle measures do not improve your cholesterol/HDL ratio our doctors may suggest you see your doctor to discuss whether cholesterol lowering medication is right for you.</p>",Cholesterol Status
non-hdl-cholesterol,Non HDL Cholesterol,"<h3>About</h3><p>Your total cholesterol is broken down into 2 main components; HDL (good) cholesterol and LDL (bad). There are more types of harmful cholesterol in your blood than just LDL - these include VLDL (very low-density lipoproteins) and other lipoproteins which are thought to be even more harmful than LDL cholesterol. Non-HDL cholesterol is calculated by subtracting your HDL cholesterol value from your total cholesterol. It therefore includes all the non-protective and potentially harmful cholesterol in your blood, not just LDL. As such, it is considered to be a better marker for cardiovascular risk than total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. The recommended level of non-HDL cholesterol is below 4 mmol/L.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A low result is thought to be protective against cardiovascular disease as it means that you have low levels of potentially damaging lipoproteins circulating in your blood.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>A high result is thought to increase your risk of cardiovascular disease as it means that you have higher levels of damaging lipoproteins in your blood.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>You can aim to improve your non-HDL cholesterol by taking measures to increase your HDL cholesterol while at the same time reducing your LDL cholesterol. Aim to reduce the amount of saturated animal fats you eat and replace with healthy oils from fatty fish (salmon, herring and sardines) and plants (olive oil, seeds and nuts). </p>
<p>Losing weight if you are overweight or obese can help, as can taking more exercise, especially if you are sedentary.</p>",Cholesterol Status
apolipoprotein-a1,Apolipoprotein A1,"<h3>About</h3><p>Apolipoprotein A1, or ApoA1 is a major protein that is a component of high-density lipoprotein, or HDL cholesterol. It helps clear cholesterol from the blood by removing cholesterol from organs and tissues to be destroyed by the liver.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of apo A1, especially if increased levels of Apolipoprotein B are also seen, could be indicative of an increased risk of coronary heart disease.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>High levels of apo A1 are thought to be protective against heart disease.</p>",Cholesterol Status
apolipoprotein-b,Apolipoprotein B,"<h3>About</h3><p>Apolipoprotein B, or ApoB is the primary apolipoprotein of low-density lipoproteins (LDL or bad cholesterol). It is responsible for carrying cholesterol to tissues.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>High levels of Apolipoprotein B can lead to plaques that cause vascular disease, or atherosclerosis, which increases the risk of heart disease. There is evidence that levels of apo B are a better indicator of heart disease risk than total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol.</p>",Cholesterol Status
lipoproteina,Lipoprotein(a),"<h3>About</h3><p>Lipoproteins transport cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. Lipoprotein(a) which is also known as Lp(a) is a risk factor for heart disease especially when LDL cholesterol is also raised. Lp(a) can accelerate the development of plaques forming in the arteries, which narrow and harden the arteries. The concentration of Lp(a) within the blood is genetically determined and will remain fairly constant in an individual over their lifetime.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>High levels of Lp(a) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including early heart disease, heart attack and stroke. Lp(a) levels may be raised in people with a family history of heart disease.</p>",Cholesterol Status
lp-pla2,Lp PLA2,"<h3>About</h3><p>The enzyme lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) plays a role in the inflammation of blood vessels, promoting the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries. Lp-PLA2 is a risk marker for cardiovascular disease and because it is produced in the plaque itself, Lp-PLA2 is thought to be more sensitive at assessing cardiovascular disease risk than traditional inflammatory markers, such as CRP.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>An elevated Lp-PLA2 level indicates an increased risk of having a heart attack or stroke.</p>",Cholesterol Status

apob-apoa-ratio,ApoB : ApoA ratio,"<h3>About</h3><p>The apoB/apoA ratio (apo-ratio) looks at how much unhealthy Apolipoprotein B is within the blood, and divides this by how much protective Apolipoprotein A-I is present. A low number (typically below 1) is considered optimal, with results higher than this suggesting an increase in the risk of experiencing a heart attack or stroke in the future.</p>",Cholesterol Status
total-cholesterol,Total Cholesterol,"<h3>About</h3><p>Cholesterol is an essential fat (lipid) in the body. Although it has a bad reputation it has some important functions, including building cell membranes and producing a number of essential hormones including testosterone and oestradiol. Cholesterol is manufactured in the liver and also comes from the food we eat. Although there are a number of different types of cholesterol, the two main components of total cholesterol are HDL (high density lipoprotein) which is protective against heart disease and LDL (low density lipoprotein) which, in high levels, can contribute to cardiovascular disease.
Your total cholesterol result on its own is of limited value in understanding your risk of heart disease; high levels of HDL cholesterol can cause a raised total cholesterol result but may actually be protective against heart disease. Equally, you can have a normal total cholesterol level but have low levels of protective HDL cholesterol. The most important factors are how much HDL and LDL cholesterol you have, and what proportion of your total cholesterol is made up of protective HDL cholesterol. We give a detailed breakdown of the components of your total cholesterol in the rest of this cholesterol profile.</p>",Cholesterol Status
hdl-cholesterol-1,HDL Cholesterol,"<h3>About</h3><p>HDL cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein) is a molecule in the body which removes cholesterol from the bloodstream and transports it to the liver where it is broken down and removed from the body in bile. HDL cholesterol is commonly known as 'good cholesterol'.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Lower levels of HDL can indicate an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This is because HDL works to get rid of excess cholesterol from cells and within vessel walls.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of HDL are protective against cardiovascular disease. This is because having higher levels of HDL increases the amount of cholesterol that is being transported to the liver for disposal. This reduces the amount of cholesterol deposited within artery walls, lowering the risk of hypertension and blockages.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>You may be able to improve your HDL cholesterol levels by eating more oily fish (like salmon, mackerel and herring) as well as healthy oils found in plant foods such as chia seeds, flax, nuts and olive oil. These are all staples of the Mediterranean diet which has been shown to be one of the best diets for heart health. </p>
<p>Losing weight and taking regular exercise also has lots of benefits for your cholesterol levels, raising HDL while lowering LDL and triglycerides.</p>",Cholesterol Status
ldl-7-subfractions,LDL - 7 Subfractions,"<h3>About</h3><p>This test will report on the levels of LDL types 1 and 2 which are the larger LDL particles, and LDL types 3 through 7 which are the smaller denser particles that are more strongly associated with atheroma formation.</p>",Cholesterol Status
calprotectin,Calprotectin,"<h3>About</h3><p>White blood cells release the protein calprotectin when there is inflammation in the GI tract. High levels of inflammation in the GI tract results in an increased amount of calprotectin released into the stool. Measuring the level of calprotectin in the stool can help distinguish between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and non-inflammatory bowel conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A normal faecal calprotectin result may mean that any bowel symptoms are less likely to be caused by an inflammatory bowel disorder.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>A high faecal calprotectin result indicates inflammation in the GI tract, but does not explain its location or cause. Often, the degree of elevation of the result is relative to the severity of the inflammation.</p>
<p>Bacterial and some parasitic infections can also cause an elevated faecal calprotectin result.</p>",Inflammation
crp,CRP,"<h3>About</h3><p>C Reactive Protein (CRP) is a protein made in the liver in response to inflammation or infection in the body.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>It can rise very rapidly when tissues are inflamed as a result of infection. It is a non-specific test as although it can identify that infection and inflammation is occuring in the body, it cannot specify where.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>Occasionally, there is no obvious inflammation or infection in the body and the CRP is raised persistently. This is largely thought to be as a result of an unhealthy lifestyle – a diet rich in trans fats and sugar and lack of exercise. Eating a healthy diet rich in fruit and vegetables and avoiding processed foods along with engaging in regular exercise can help to reduce inflammation and therefore CRP levels in the body. Green leafy vegetables, fatty fish and nuts such as almonds and walnuts are thought to be good anti-inflammatory foods.</p>",Inflammation
esr,ESR,"<h3>About</h3><p>ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) is a non-specific inflammation marker. It measures the rate at which red blood cells fall to the bottom of a tube. The blood cells fall quicker during inflammation, as there are more proteins in the blood, caused by the inflammation. It is said to be nonspecific because increases do not indicate exactly where the inflammation in your body is, or what is causing it, and also because it can be affected by other conditions other than inflammation.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated ESR scores indicate that there is inflammation ongoing in the body. This could suggest a wide range of causes, including infection and autoimmune disease, but also pregnancy and anaemia.</p>
<p>Significantly elevated ESR scores can allude to more sinister conditions, for example, in patients with multiple myeloma.</p>",Inflammation
crp-hs,CRP HS,"<h3>About</h3><p>C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is an inflammation marker used to assess whether there is inflammation in the body - it does not identify where the inflammation is located. High Sensitivity CRP (CRP-hs) is a test used to detect low-level inflammation thought to damage blood vessels which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. </p>
<p>When you suffer a serious injury or infection you experience significant inflammation around the site of injury - such as the swelling around a twisted ankle. Any injury like this will cause your CRP-hs to rise.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A low level of CRP-hs means that there is very little inflammation detected in your body. This may indicate a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Raised levels of CRP-hs may indicate chronic inflammation which may mean that you are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including a heart attack and stroke. Very elevated levels are normally associated with some type of infection or inflammation - even a common cold will cause CRP-hs levels to rise. An acute elevation of CRP-hs will normally subside once an infection has cleared.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>Occasionally, there is no obvious inflammation or infection in the body yet CRP-hs is raised persistently. Factors which can contribute to high inflammation include having high blood pressure, smoking and elevated LDL cholesterol. A diet high in trans fats and sugar as well as lack of exercise are also thought to promote an inflammatory response, as is being overweight or obese. </p>
<p>Eating a healthy diet rich in fruit and vegetables and avoiding processed foods along with regular exercise can help to reduce inflammation and therefore CRP levels in the body. Green leafy vegetables, fatty fish and nuts such as almonds and walnuts are thought to be good anti-inflammatory foods.</p>",Inflammation
aldolase,Aldolase,"<h3>About</h3><p>Aldolase is an enzyme found throughout the body, particularly in muscles and in the liver. The enzyme is needed to trigger specific chemical reactions and helps the muscles turn sugar into energy.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>High levels of aldolase can indicate muscle or liver damage.</p>",Muscle Health
creatine-kinase,Creatine Kinase,"<h3>About</h3><p>Creatinine kinase (CK) is an enzyme which is necessary for muscle function and is found in the heart and skeletal muscles as well as other tissues. It signifies muscle cell damage and death and is measured to diagnose and monitor muscle damage. CK levels tend to be higher in people with greater muscle mass.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of CK can be found in individuals with liver disease, and in those with muscular diseases which deplete their muscle mass.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>The level of CK in the blood is measured to assess muscle damage - it can rise rapidly after muscle trauma, but will subside as the damage repairs. If CK continues to rise it indicates that muscle damage is not being repaired. If you have been to the gym the day before your blood test you may well have raised levels of CK.</p>
<p>Several drugs including cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins), have the potential to damage muscle and increase CK levels. Drinking too much alcohol slightly increases CK as well.</p>",Muscle Health
ferritin,Ferritin,"<h3>About</h3><p>Ferritin is a protein which stores iron in your cells and tissues. Usually, the body incorporates iron into haemoglobin to be transported around the body, but when it has a surplus, it stores the remaining iron in ferritin for later use. Measuring ferritin levels gives us a good indication of the amount of iron stored in your body.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of ferritin can indicate anaemia which can be caused by excessive or chronic bleeding (menstruating women are at increased risk of low iron), poor absorption of iron in the gut due to an inflammatory bowel condition, or too little iron in the diet.</p>
<p>Often, at the beginning of iron deficiency anaemia, your ferritin levels may be low but your iron levels are normal; this is because in early anaemia, your body will deplete the iron stores first, whilst iron levels will still be sufficient.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Raised levels of ferritin can be found in individuals with an inherited iron overload syndrome called haemochromatosis, in which a genetic mutation causes the intestines to uncontrollably absorb iron at very high levels. As the body has no way of getting rid of excess iron, iron continues to rise which can lead to organ damage, diabetes and other chronic conditions. </p>
<p>Ferritin is found in the liver, so sometimes liver damage can cause an elevated ferritin level. It is also an inflammation marker which means it can be elevated if you have an inflammatory condition like rheumatoid arthritis, or an infection of some kind.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>Low ferritin levels can often be improved by changes to your diet. Red meat, dark green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale, fortified cereals and breads as well as pulses (beans, peas and lentils) are all excellent dietary sources of iron. To help improve your absorption of iron, eat iron-rich foods alongside a good source of vitamin C - such as orange or lemon juice. Iron supplements are also widely available; talk to your pharmacist about which one is right for you. Where appropriate, our doctors will advise you see your GP.</p>
<p>If our doctors suspect iron overload they will advise you to see your doctor. Otherwise, if you have high levels of iron in your blood, reducing your intake of iron-rich foods such as red meat, avoiding using iron cookware and avoiding consuming vitamin C with foods that are rich in iron (as vitamin C increases iron absorption) can help iron levels. If you are supplementing with iron it may be a good idea to reduce your dose as high levels of iron can be damaging. Our doctors will advise. Another surprising way to reduce iron levels is to donate blood regularly, as this gets rid of excess iron in the body.</p>",Iron Status
iron,Iron,"<h3>About</h3><p>Iron is a mineral that is essential for life. It is a component of haemoglobin, a protein in our red blood cells that is responsible for transporting oxygen around our body. If we don't have enough iron, our haemoglobin levels fall and we can't get sufficient oxygen to our cells. This can cause symptoms which include fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath.  Serum iron is a very transient reading and can be influenced by the amount of iron-rich food in your diet in the days before your blood test. For this reason, iron is rarely looked at on its own, and is interpreted alongside other markers in an iron status test.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A low result could mean you've not eaten much iron recently. You may have low iron if you suffer from an inflammatory bowel condition which affects your ability to absorb iron. Whilst low serum iron levels may suggest iron deficiency it is important to look at it in the context of other iron markers, particularly ferritin.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>A high result can often be the result of taking too many iron supplements or from eating a recent iron-rich meal. However, a high result could also mean that you have iron overload syndrome (haemochromatosis), an inherited condition where your body stores too much iron. This would usually be accompanied by elevated ferritin and transferrin saturation levels.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>Low iron levels can be improved by incorporating more iron into your diet or by taking an iron supplement. Red meat, dark green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale, fortified cereals and breads as well as pulses (beans, peas and lentils) are all good dietary sources of iron. To improve your absorption of iron, eat it alongside a food rich in vitamin C - such as orange or lemon juice.</p>
<p>If you have high levels of iron in your blood, reducing your intake of iron-rich foods such as red meat, avoiding using iron cookware and avoiding consuming vitamin C with foods that are rich in iron (as vitamin C increases iron absorption) can help get iron levels down. Another surprising way to reduce iron levels is to donate blood regularly, as this gets rid of excess iron in the body.</p>",Iron Status
tibc,TIBC,"<h3>About</h3><p>Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) is a measure of the ability of your body to efficiently carry iron through the blood.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low TIBC is sometimes caused by iron overload syndrome, called hereditary haemochromatosis, an inherited genetic condition which causes the intestines to uncontrollably absorb iron at very high levels. As the body has no way of ridding itself of excess iron, this can result in a build up of iron over time which can lead to organ damage, diabetes and other chronic conditions.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated TIBC can indicate iron deficiency. This can be caused by a lack of iron in the diet, gastrointestinal bleeds such as peptic ulcers, and pregnancy.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>Iron deficiency can be improved by increasing iron-rich foods in your diet. Iron in animal protein like red meat  (heme iron) is the most efficiently absorbed type of iron, but non-heme iron found in green leafy vegetables, seeds and legumes can also improve your iron levels. </p>
<p>Excess iron can be controlled through therapeutic phlebotomy, where blood is regularly removed through a vein in your arm to keep iron levels at healthy levels.</p>",Iron Status
transferrin-saturation-1,Transferrin Saturation,"<h3>About</h3><p>Transferrin is made in the liver and is the major protein in the blood which binds to iron and transports it round the body. This test measures how much this protein is 'saturated' by iron.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low transferrin saturation levels can indicate iron deficiency as it means that very little of the transferrin is saturated with iron. Iron deficiency can be caused by blood loss (gastrointestinal bleeding or menstruation), lack of dietary iron, or pregnancy. Inflammatory bowel conditions can also cause low iron through malabsorption.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>High transferrin saturation levels can indicate iron overload (hereditary haemochromatosis) as it means that a high proportion of your transferrin is saturated with iron.</p>",Iron Status
uibc,UIBC,"<h3>About</h3><p>Unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) represents the portion of iron binding sites on transferrin that are not occupied by iron. UIBC is often measured along with iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) as a diagnostic tool to determine various iron disorders.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A low UIBC indicates that you may have too much iron in your blood which may be due to iron overload syndrome (hereditary haemochromatosis). A low UIBC means that a large proportion of the binding sites on transferrin are saturated with iron.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>A high UIBC signifies iron deficiency as it means that a large proportion of the binding sites are not saturated with iron. Iron deficiency could be due to low dietary intake of iron, blood loss (including gastrointestinal bleeding and menstruation) or pregnancy.</p>",Iron Status
oestradiol,Oestradiol,"<h3>About</h3><p>Oestradiol is a female steroid hormone, produced in the ovaries of women and to a much lesser extent in the testes of men. It is the strongest of three oestrogens and is responsible for the female reproductive system as well as the growth of breast tissue and bone thickness. In pre-menopausal women, oestradiol levels vary throughout the monthly cycle, peaking at ovulation. In women, oestradiol levels decline with age, culminating with the menopause when the ovaries stop producing eggs. Low oestradiol can cause many symptoms associated with the menopause, including hot flushes, night sweats and mood swings. Low oestradiol can also cause osteoporosis.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of oestradiol in women can lead to osteoporosis, problems with the menstrual cycle and fertility, as well as fatigue. In women who are peri-menopausal it is common for oestradiol levels to fluctuate from month to month. Declining and low oestradiol can cause many symptoms associated with the menopause such as hot flushes, mood swings, fatigue and headaches. In younger women low estradiol can be caused by excessive exercise, problems with pituitary function and eating disorders (anorexia nervosa). </p>
<p>There is currently little research into the effects of low oestradiol on men, however associations have been found between lower oestradiol levels and increased quantities of body fat, decreased bone strength as well as with some sexual problems. Conventional medicine does not routinely treat men with low levels of oestradiol, although this may change with future research.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Raised oestradiol in women can cause acne, constipation, loss of sex drive and low moods, as well as raising the risk of uterine and breast cancer.</p>
<p>Oestradiol can also be raised in men due to excess fat (which produces oestradiol) or in relation to testosterone levels which have declined with age. Raised oestradiol in men can cause the growth of breast tissue, the loss of libido and infertility. There can be many causes for a high oestradiol including high BMI, alcohol consumption, stress and the use of certain medications (including those aimed at raising testosterone) as well as a number of medical conditions including pituitary and testicular issues.</p>",Hormones
progesterone,Progesterone,"<h3>About</h3><p>Progesterone is a steroid hormone produced in the corpus luteum and the adrenal glands. Its main role is to prepare the body for and support a pregnancy. It is produced in increasing amounts in the second half of the menstrual cycle. Progesterone is normally tested on day 21 of your menstrual cycle to assess whether ovulation has taken place. </p>
<p>Although progesterone is considered a female hormone, men also produce progesterone in the adrenal glands and the testes. Progesterone in men plays a role in testosterone production.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Progesterone is lowest at the beginning of the menstrual cycle and reaches a peak 7 days before a woman's period is due if ovulation has taken place. This is day 21 of a 28 day cycle, many women take a progesterone test at this time to see whether ovulation has occurred. </p>
<p>Low progesterone in men may affect testosterone levels resulting in symptoms such as loss of libido, inability to gain muscle and erectile dysfunction.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>A result of 30 or more signifies that ovulation almost certainly occurred. If your result is above normal it may indicate that you are pregnant as progesterone rises very rapidly if conception has taken place. </p>
<p>Elevated progesterone in men may be as a result of prescribed progesterone for managing a prostate condition or for infertility.</p>",Hormones
testosterone,Testosterone,"<h3>About</h3><p>Testosterone is a hormone that causes male characteristics. For men, it helps to regulate sex drive and has a role in controlling bone mass, fat distribution, muscle mass, strength and the production of red blood cells and sperm. Testosterone is produced in the testicles of men and, in much smaller amounts, in the ovaries of women. Testosterone levels in men naturally decline after the age of 30, although lower than normal levels can occur at any age and can cause low libido, erectile dysfunction, difficulty in gaining and maintaining muscle mass and lack of energy. Although women have much lower amounts of testosterone than men, it is important for much the same reasons, playing a role in libido, the distribution of muscle and fat and the formation of red blood cells. All laboratories will slightly differ in the reference ranges they apply because they are based on the population they are testing. The normal range is set so that 95% of men will fall into it. For greater consistency, we use the guidance from the British Society for Sexual Medicine (BSSM) which advises that low testosterone can be diagnosed when testosterone is consistently below the reference range, and that levels below 12 nmol/L could also be considered low, especially in men who also report symptoms of low testosterone or who have low levels of free testosterone.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>For men, it is much more common to have borderline or low testosterone than to have naturally elevated testosterone. There are many factors which can contribute to low testosterone, including increasing age, obesity, chronic illness, alcoholism and stress (including over-exercising), as well as certain genetic conditions such as Klinefelter syndrome. A common reason for low testosterone is steroid use, where high circulating testosterone in the body causes the natural production of testosterone by the testes to shut down.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated testosterone is not commonly seen in men unless you are taking supplements aimed at raising testosterone levels e.g. testosterone replacement therapy or steroids. It is important to keep testosterone to within the normal range for men so that you don't experience the side effects of elevated testosterone. Having high testosterone can impact the levels of other hormones, such as oestradiol, and can switch off the body's own testosterone production.
In rare circumstances, high testosterone may be due to a testosterone-producing tumour. </p>
<p>In women, raised testosterone can indicate polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). If you are experiencing irregular periods or no periods at all, excessive hair growth on the body and thinning hair on the head, weight gain and acne we recommend you speak with your doctor.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>If you want to increase your testosterone there are some lifestyle changes that you can make that may boost levels. Aim to get between 7 and 9 hours sleep per night and avoid alcohol. Keep your weight in a healthy range and eat a diet rich in healthy fats, protein and carbohydrates (avoiding refined carbs and sugar). Strength exercise can boost testosterone as can HIIT (high intensity interval training). Vitamin D, magnesium and zinc have been shown to help testosterone levels, so if you don't get enough from your diet (and sunshine in the case of vitamin D) then consider supplements. Finally, try to minimise stress (including exercise induced stress from over-reaching and over-training) and make enough time for rest and relaxation.</p>",Hormones
free-testosterone-calc,Free Testosterone - Calc.,"<h3>About</h3><p>Most testosterone circulating in the blood is bound to proteins, in particular SHBG and albumin; only 2-3 % of testosterone is free and available to cells. This test uses an algorithm to calculate the level of free or unbound testosterone in relation to total testosterone, SHBG and albumin.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Even if you have normal total testosterone levels you might have low free testosterone levels, especially if you have elevated SHBG. Low free testosterone can lead to symptoms which can include of lack of libido, difficulty gaining muscle, and low mood.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated free testosterone is normally the result of having high levels of total testosterone. High testosterone is not common in men and is normally caused by taking supplements aimed at increasing testosterone levels e.g. testosterone replacement therapy or steroids. Having high testosterone levels can impact the production of other hormones and can also cause your body to stop producing its own testosterone. Long term, it carries other health risks like high cholesterol and blood clots which raise your risk of heart disease and strokes.</p>
<p>In women, high free testosterone can be seen with polycystic ovaries, a condition in which a woman produces high levels of male hormones which can cause irregular periods as well as some male physical characteristics.</p>",Hormones
fsh,FSH,"<h3>About</h3><p>Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) is produced in the pituitary gland and is important for women in the production of eggs by the ovaries and for men for men in the production of sperm. </p>
<p>In the first half of the menstrual cycle in women, FSH stimulates the enlargement of follicles within the ovaries. Each of these follicles will help to increase oestradiol levels. One follicle will become dominant and will be released by the ovary (ovulation), after which follicle stimulating hormone levels drop during the second half of the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>In men, FSH acts on the seminiferous tubules of the testicles where they stimulate immature sperm cells to develop into mature sperm.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>In women low levels can signal that you are not ovulating or are pregnant. It can also be caused by use of oestrogen-containing contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy.</p>
<p>Low levels of follicle stimulating hormone in men can be a sign of underlying problems with the pituitary gland which can impact upon sperm production. Low FSH also be caused by the use of medications which contain testosterone or other androgens.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Levels of FSH rise in women as egg production declines, so it may be used in certain circumstances to assess the likelihood of whether a woman is going through the menopause. </p>
<p>The National Institute for Health &amp; Care Excellence (NICE) recommend that FSH testing is only considered to diagnose menopause in women aged 40-45 with menopausal symptoms (including a change in their menstrual cycle) or in women under the age of 40 in whom menopause is suspected. </p>
<p>Due to significant fluctuation in FSH levels around the time of menopause, there is a chance that this test may show normal pre-menopause levels of FSH in someone who is going through, or has been through, the menopause.</p>
<p>A high FSH level in a man may mean the testicles are not functioning correctly. This can be caused by damage to the testicles, increasing age, alcohol problems, diabetes and rarely by a tumour of the pituitary gland.</p>",Hormones
17-oh-progesterone,17-OH Progesterone,"<h3>About</h3><p>17 Hydroxyprogesterone is a steroid hormone made during the synthesis of other hormones such as cortisol and oestrogen. It is produced in the adrenal glands and the reproductive organs. Levels are tested to investigate cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of 17 Hydroxyprogesterone could indicate a rarer form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia which is due to a deficiency in the enzyme 17 hydroxylase.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Raised levels of 17 hydroxyprogesterone could indicate the presence of an inherited disorder called congenital adrenal hyperplasia, in which individuals produce inadequate or excessive amounts of a vast range of hormones.</p>",Hormones
lh,LH,"<h3>About</h3><p>Luteinising Hormone (LH) is produced by the pituitary gland and is important for male and female fertility. In women it governs the menstrual cycle, peaking before ovulation. In men it stimulates the production of testosterone.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of LH can be seen in secondary ovarian failure (in women)/secondary testicular failure (in men), indicating disorders of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Raised LH in women can signal that you are not ovulating or that your hormones are not in balance (as with polycystic ovaries).</p>
<p>Raised LH in men can signal that the testes are not producing enough testosterone.</p>",Hormones
prolactin,Prolactin,"<h3>About</h3><p>Prolactin is a hormone which is produced in the pituitary gland and plays a role in reproductive health. Its primary purpose is to stimulate milk production after childbirth, and in pregnant and breastfeeding women prolactin levels can soar.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>It is normal for men and women who are not pregnant or breastfeeding to have low levels of prolactin In their blood. Low levels of prolactin in a breastfeeding woman may impact her milk supply.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Men and women who produce too much prolactin are said to have hyperprolactinemia. This can be caused by a cyst on the pituitary gland which causes the pituitary to secrete more prolactin. Both men and women with high prolactin may find that they have a milky discharge from their nipples. High prolactin is associated with hypothyroidism and can be caused by some medications. In women it is also linked with polycystic ovaries. Because prolactin inhibits ovulation (which is why breastfeeding can act as a natural contraceptive), women with high prolactin levels may have fertility problems. </p>
<p>High prolactin in men can suppress testosterone and cause loss of libido and erectile dysfunction.</p>",Hormones
anti-mullerian-hormone,Anti Mullerian Hormone,"<h3>About</h3><p>Anti-Mullerian Hormone, or AMH, is a hormone produced by the ovaries. In particular, it is produced by the follicles which contain eggs within the ovary. Levels can indicate how high or low a woman's ovarian reserve is. </p>
<p>Anti Mullerian Hormone is not routinely measured in men. It may be used by specialist fertility clinics in assessing sperm production.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>In women, low AMH levels indicate a poor ovarian reserve, which may correlate with low fertility. This does not mean that a woman with low AMH levels cannot become pregnant as there are many factors which influence a woman's chances of conceiving.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>High levels of AMH in women indicate rich ovarian reserves. This is not to say that a women with a high AMH level will always conceive, as there a many factors which affect fertility.</p>
<p>Very high levels of AMH can be found in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). This is because women with PCOS have much high numbers of immature follicles, and therefore produce excess AMH.</p>",Hormones
free-androgen-index,Free Androgen Index,"<h3>About</h3><p>The free androgen index (FAI) is a calculation used to determine the amount of testosterone which is free (unbound) in the bloodstream. Most testosterone is bound to proteins sex hormone binding globulin and albumin and is not available to interact with the body's cells. The FAI is a calculation based on the ratio of testosterone and SHBG and is a measure of the amount of testosterone that is available to act on the body's tissues. </p>
<p>The free androgen index is used in women to assess the likelihood of polycystic ovarian syndrome. In men, free testosterone gives a better indication of testosterone status.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A low free androgen index could be a sign of lower than expected testosterone levels (androgen insufficiency). This can cause symptoms such as loss of libido, fatigue, and may also have an effect upon muscle and bone health. In men it can also cause problems with erectile dysfunction.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>An increased free androgen index is a sign of excessive testosterone. In women this is most commonly caused by polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Symptoms of PCOS can include irregular periods, the development of male characteristics such as unwanted hair, and acne.</p>",Hormones

pregnenolone,Pregnenolone,"<h3>About</h3><p>Pregnenolone is a chemical that is a precursor to all steroid hormones in the body. For normal steroid hormone production, cholesterol is converted into pregnenolone in the adrenal glands and then several enzymes complete the production of multiple hormones. A Pregnenolone test helps to monitor and/or rule out two of the more rare forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>If there is an enzyme deficiency in the steroid hormone production process, there is likely to be a mild to significant increase in pregnenolone.</p>",Hormones
beta-hcg,Beta HCG,"<h3>About</h3><p>HCG is a pregnancy hormone produced by the placenta when a fertilised egg implants in the uterine wall. The hormone hCG starts to be produced around six days after fertilisation and can usually be detected 10 days after a missed menstrual period.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A negative hCG result does not necessarily mean that you are not pregnant as hCG may not be detectable even with this sensitive test, especially if you tested early or ovulated late. A repeat test is recommended if your period has not arrived after another 3 days.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>An elevated hCG result  confirms a positive pregnancy test result.

testosterone-cortisol,Testosterone : Cortisol,"<h3>About</h3><p>The Testosterone/Cortisol (T:C) ratio is a marker which shows promise in assessing whether athletes are recovering well after intense training. Testosterone is an anabolic hormone which helps to build muscle, produce red blood cells and increase aerobic metabolism in muscles. Cortisol is a catabolic hormone working antagonistically with testosterone, inhibiting protein synthesis and blocking anabolic signalling. The T:C ratio is more sensitive to the stresses of training than either measure alone. Over time it can be trended to see how well you are recovering.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A 30% decrease in T:C ratio has been suggested as an indicator for insufficient recovery and can point towards overtraining.  If this is the case it is extremely important to reflect on your training routine and make sure you recover sufficiently to prevent long-term ill-health.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Chronically elevated cortisol levels in the body, breaks down muscle and weakens the immune system. For both endurance and strength training athletes, the T:C ratio provides a useful marker of possible overreaching and overtraining syndromes, which is where the body does not sufficiently recover after exercise. Poor recovery can lead to a decline in performance, physiological stress and low mood.</p>",Hormones

free-t3,Free T3,"<h3>About</h3><p>Triiodothyronine (T3) is the more active of the two thyroid hormones produced by the thyroid gland. Most T3 is bound to protein in the blood. Free T3 measures the level of T3 that is free, or unbound to protein, and is available to regulate metabolism.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of FT3 indicate that your thyroid is not producing enough thyroid hormones which means that you may have a an underactive thyroid. Symptoms of an underactive thyroid include gaining weight, feeling sensitive to cold, feeling tired, often to the point of exhaustion, and having dry skin and hair.
In some people, their T3 is low because their body has difficulty in converting T4 to T3.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Raised levels of free T3 can indicate an overactive thyroid. This happens when your thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone. Symptoms of an overactive thyroid include being sensitive to heat, losing weight, having a rapid heartbeat and feeling anxious and jittery.
Some people may have high levels of free T3 if they are taking too much thyroid replacement hormone, especially if they are taking T3 (liothyronine) or a combination of T4 and T3 (e.g NDT).</p>",Thyroid Hormones
free-thyroxine,Free Thyroxine,"<h3>About</h3><p>Thyroxine (T4) is one of two hormones produced by the thyroid gland. It works to speed up the rate of your metabolism. Most T4 is bound to carrier proteins in the blood - it is only the free, or unbound, T4 that is active in the body, which is measured in this test.
Free T4 is the less active of the two main thyroid hormones. To have an impact on your cells it needs to convert to the more active T3 when your body needs it.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low free T4 may indicate that the thyroid is underactive (hypothyroidism) and is struggling to produce enough thyroid hormones. A low FT4 result means that there is less thyroid hormone available to convert to the active T3, resulting in a slower metabolism. There are numerous symptoms of an underactive thyroid - including sensitivity to cold, gaining weight and low mood and depression.</p>
<p>Free T4 levels may also be slightly lower in pregnant women due to an increase in the amount of the carrier protein, thyroid binding globulin. This means that more T4 is bound, leaving less &quot;free&quot; to be biologically active in your cells.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Raised free T4 can indicate an overactive thyroid. High levels of FT4 tend to lead to excess of the other thyroid hormone, T3, resulting in an overactive metabolism. Symptoms of an overactive thyroid can include sensitivity to heat, difficulty in gaining weight, a rapid heartbeat and feelings of nervous anxiety. </p>
<p>Sometimes raised FT4 can be seen if you have already been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder and are taking too much thyroid hormone replacement (thyroxine).</p>",Thyroid Hormones
total-thyroxine,Total Thyroxine,"<h3>About</h3><p>T4 (Thyroxine) is the main hormone produced by the thyroid gland. T4 is not biologically active, and must be converted to T3 before it can become active in regulating metabolism. Some T4 is bound to proteins, while some T4 is free or unbound. This test measures the level of total T4 in your blood.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of T4 may indicate dietary issues such as or an iodine deficiency, hypothyroidism or a pituitary problem.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>High T4 levels may indicate hyperthyroidism, or other thyroid problems, such as thyroiditis. High levels of protein in the blood and too much iodine in the body can also cause elevated T4 levels.</p>",Thyroid Hormones
tsh,TSH,"<h3>About</h3><p>Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is produced in the pituitary gland in order to regulate the production of thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) by the thyroid gland. If thyroid hormones in the blood are low, then more TSH is produced to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more of them. If thyroid hormone levels are high, then the pituitary produces less TSH to slow the production of thyroid hormones. </p>
<p>If TSH is too high or too low, it normally signifies that there is a problem with the thyroid gland which is causing it to under or over produce thyroid hormones. Sometimes a disorder of the pituitary gland can also cause abnormal TSH levels.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low TSH means that your thyroid gland is over-producing thyroid hormones and you may have an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism). An overactive thyroid means that your body's metabolism is speeded up which can cause many symptoms, including feeling too hot, losing weight, feeling nervous and jittery and having a rapid heart beat. An overactive thyroid also is associated with health risks like atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis (weak bones). </p>
<p>Low TSH can also occur in people who have a diagnosed thyroid condition and are taking replacement thyroid hormones. It can mean that their medication needs to be reduced, especially if it is accompanied by symptoms of an overactive thyroid. </p>
<p>Low TSH that is accompanied by low levels of T3 and T4 can be a sign of an underlying pituitary problem.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>High TSH means that your thyroid gland is under-producing thyroid hormones and you may have an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). An underactive thyroid means that your body isn't producing sufficient thyroid hormones to keep your metabolism running at a healthy level. Symptoms are numerous and typically include putting on weight, finding it difficult to lose weight, feeling cold when people around you are warm, feeling very tired and having no energy for day-to-day activities and having dry skin and hair. Hypothyroidism carries long term health risks such as elevated cholesterol and a higher risk of heart disease.</p>",Thyroid Hormones
hba1c,HbA1c,"<h3>About</h3><p>Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), also known as glycated haemoglobin, is a longer term measure of glucose levels in your blood than a simple blood glucose test. Glucose attaches itself to the haemoglobin in your red blood cells, and as your cells live for around 12-16 weeks, it gives us a good indication of the average level of sugar in your blood over a 3 month period.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A low HbA1c shows that you are currently not at risk of diabetes. However, it is important to monitor your HbA1c levels regularly so that you keep your blood sugar in the healthy range. </p>
<p>If you have already been diagnosed with diabetes and are taking medication, a low result means that you are controlling your condition. </p>
<p>HbA1c results can be artificially lowered by iron deficiency anaemia, and by haemoglobin problems such as sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia. If you have one of these conditions then a fructosamine test can be used to check how your body is handling glucose.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>A high result can indicate pre-diabetes (a condition when blood sugar levels are high but not yet at diabetic levels) or full-blown diabetes. If you have already been diagnosed with diabetes and are taking medication, an elevated result can indicate that you are not adequately controlling your condition.</p>
<p>Being overweight or obese is the biggest risk factor for high blood sugar and diabetes. However, inactivity, certain ethnicities, and some conditions such as polycystic ovaries can also raise your risk of diabetes.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>For people with type 2 diabetes, the goal is to lower HbA1C levels to a healthier level. The good news is that pre-diabetes and even diabetes can be reversed through weight loss (calorie restriction), exercise and maintaining a healthy diet low in sugar and refined carbohydrates. In its later stages, type 2 diabetes may need management through medication.</p>",Diabetes
insulin,Insulin,"<h3>About</h3><p>Insulin is an important metabolic hormone. Made in your pancreas, insulin is produced after eating in order to move the sugar from your blood into your cells for future energy use. If we eat too much, especially sugar and starchy foods, our bodies are flooded with insulin and over time our cells become resistant to the effects of insulin, leaving high levels of sugar and insulin in the bloodstream.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A low insulin result can indicate type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition which means that the pancreas can no longer produce insulin. If no insulin is present to move glucose from your blood into your cells, then blood sugar can rise rapidly leading to symptoms of excessive thirst, frequent urination and fatigue. People with type 1 diabetes will need to inject insulin for the rest of their lives in order to control their blood sugar.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Raised insulin can mean that you are becoming insulin resistant which is a pre-diabetic condition.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>Elevated insulin is a marker for pre-diabetes and diabetes as it signifies that your body is becoming less efficient at moving sugar from your blood into your cells. Controlling your blood sugar will also improve your insulin levels. Studies have shown that blood sugar and insulin both improve through weight loss achieved through calorie restriction. Eating a diet low in sugar and refined carbohydrates, high in whole grains, fruit and vegetables can also help improve insulin levels. Insulin sensitivity (how sensitive the body's cells are to the effects of insulin) can also be improved through exercise as well as getting sufficient sleep.</p>",Diabetes

fructosamine,Fructosamine,"<h3>About</h3><p>Fructosamine is a marker of sugar control in the body reflecting the average sugar level in the blood over the previous 2–3 weeks. It is the best way for people with haemoglobin problems to check how well their body has been controlling their glucose levels over the past few weeks. This is because conditions such as sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia can cause a lower than expected HbA1c result.</p>
<p>When glucose levels are raised in the blood over a period of time, glucose molecules permanently combine with proteins in the blood. These combined molecules remain for the life of the protein and provide a record of the average amount of glucose present in the blood over that time period.</p>
<p>The fructosamine test reflects the average glucose levels over a 2 to 3 week time period as serum proteins have a lifespan, of around 14 to 21 days.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>An elevated result indicates poor sugar control. In general, the higher the fructosamine concentration the higher the average blood glucose level.</p>",Diabetes

Intrinsic factor is necessary to extract vitamin B12 from the food we eat. Without sufficient intrinsic factor available, vitamin B12 is unabsorbed and the body cannot produce enough red blood cells which leads to the autoimmune condition pernicious anaemia.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>The presence of intrinsic factor antibodies alongside a decreased vitamin B12 level and/or increased methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels indicates pernicious anemia is likely.</p>",Autoimmunity
thyroglobulin-antibodies,Thyroglobulin Antibodies,"<h3>About</h3><p>This test looks for antibodies to thyroglobulin, a protein which is specific to the thyroid gland. Under normal circumstances it does not enter the bloodstream, but if your thyroid is inflamed or under attack from the body's own immune system, then thyroglobulin can be secreted and antibodies detected.</p>
<p>Most cases of thyroid disease are caused by an autoimmune condition where the thyroid gland is attacked by the body's own immune system. This can cause the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormone (as in the case of Graves' disease) or to produce less as the cells in the thyroid gland are gradually destroyed (as in the case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis).</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>It is normal to have low levels of thyroglobulin antibodies in your blood.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated thyroglobulin antibodies mean that your immune system is attacking your thyroid gland. This can affect the gland's ability to produce thyroid hormones. If you already know that you have a thyroid condition, or your test results show that you are under-producing thyroid hormones, then an autoimmune condition is almost certainly the cause. </p>
<p>Having elevated antibodies raises your risk of going on to develop a thyroid disorder so it is recommended that you regularly monitor your thyroid hormones, especially if you become symptomatic.

homocysteine,Homocysteine,"<h3>About</h3><p>Homocysteine is an amino acid used by the body to make protein and to build and maintain tissue. Homocysteine is a product of methionine metabolism and in healthy cells, is quickly converted to other products.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of homocysteine are normally present in very small amounts in all cells of the body.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Excessive levels in your blood may increase your risk of stroke, certain types of heart disease, and disease of the blood vessels of the arms, legs and feet (peripheral artery disease). Although a raised homocysteine is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it is not known whether it is causative or a result of the condition.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>As both folic acid and vitamin B12 are needed to metabolise homocysteine. Those who are deficient in these vitamins may have increased levels of homocysteine. Homocysteine can be lowered through increased intake of vitamin B12 and folic acid. </p>
<p>Vitamin B12 is found mostly in animal proteins such as meat, fish, milk and eggs. Because of this, vegetarians and vegans are at a greater risk of low vitamin B12 as there are almost no plant sources of this vitamin, yeast flakes are a good source which can be added to vegetarian foods. Raising your B12 levels can be as simple as taking a daily or weekly supplement, but if that doesn't improve levels then you may need a regular injection from your GP.</p>

beta-carotene,Beta-Carotene,"<h3>About</h3><p>Beta-carotene is a fat-soluble carotenoid found in plants, and is what gives carrots their orange colour. Your body converts beta-carotene into vitamin A (retinol) and is a safe source of vitamin A because your body only converts as much as it needs. Excess vitamin A can be toxic. Vitamin A is important for the normal reproduction of cells (cellular differentiation) as well as good vision and the proper development of an embryo and fetus. Beta-carotene is also an antioxidant so protects the body from damaging free radicals. Sources of beta-carotene include carrots, tomatoes, spinach, lettuce, sweet potatoes, squash and broccoli.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of beta-carotene may indicate that you are not consuming enough vitamin A. However, it may instead be that your body is not absorbing the vitamins properly. This can occur in those with conditions such as pancreatitis, coeliac disease, and cystic fibrosis.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of beta-carotene may indicate hypervitaminosis A, which is caused by consuming excess amounts of vitamin A. This may happen if you eat too much fish or liver, but can also be caused by long term use of particular acne treatments.</p>",Vitamins

vitamin-b12-active,Vitamin B12 - Active,"<h3>About</h3><p>Vitamin B12 is important for production of red blood cells which carry oxygen around the body. B12 is also involved in metabolism and the nervous system and prolonged lack of vitamin B12 may cause nerve damage. Although Vitamin B12 is almost entirely found in animal-based foods, many vegetarian and vegan products, especially plant milks are now fortified with Vitamin B12.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels are seen in people with pernicious anaemia, an autoimmune disease which prevents the absorption of vitamin B12, and anyone who suffers from absorption problems including the elderly, people with inflammatory bowel disease and people who consume too much alcohol. Conditions and medications which affect the body's production of stomach acid can also cause absorption problems; people with hypothyroidism as well as individuals who are taking proton pump inhibitors (PPI's) should be careful to ensure their vitamin B12 levels remain normal. Because of the lack of animal products in their diets, vegetarians and vegans may have an increased risk of being vitamin B12 deficient, especially if they don't eat foods which have been fortified with vitamin B12 or take a B12 supplement.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>A high level of vitamin B12 is usually the result of taking too many B12 supplements. Raised levels of vitamin B12 can indicate a liver disorder, such as acute hepatitis or cirrhosis. This is because vitamin B12 is stored by the liver, and so when it is damaged, it cannot uptake more and leaks. Elevated levels are also seen in some blood disorders.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>If you are found to be low in vitamin B12 you can aim to increase your level by taking a vitamin B12 supplement. If that doesn't improve levels then you may need a regular injection from your GP. Vegetarians and vegans can improve dietary intake of vitamin B12 by incorporating fortified foods into their diet as well as adding nutritional yeast flakes to their meals.</p>",Vitamins
folate-serum,Folate - Serum,"<h3>About</h3><p>Folate is a B vitamin which acts as a coenzyme in the metabolism of amino acids. It is also vital for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines which are essential for DNA synthesis and red cell formation. Folate is also especially important during the first trimester of pregnancy so if you are thinking of becoming pregnant it is important to make sure your folate levels are normal.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Really low levels of these vitamins can go on to cause anaemia where you not only don't produce enough red blood cells, but also the cells you do produce don’t work as well as they should and are bigger than normal. But even slightly low levels of either of these vitamins can begin to make you feel unwell. Often people can feel fatigued, have pins and needles, muscle weakness, mouth complaints and problems with mood and memory. For the athlete this can result in reduced performance and lack of maintenance of maximal exertion. If combined with other deficiencies, such as vitamin D deficiency, it can increase your stress-fracture risk. </p>
<p>You might become deficient in these vitamins for three main reasons: diet, inability to absorb them from the gut and due to some medications or excessive alcohol. For athletes any of these can be the cause, but there is particular concern over people who avoid vegetables.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>High folate levels are usually caused by over-supplementation. It is a signal to reduce or stop your supplements until your levels get back to normal.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>Low folate levels can be improved by incorporating more folate rich foods into your diet. Folate is found in a wide variety of foods such as cooked dried beans, peas, and lentils, spinach and asparagus as well as fortified foods such as breakfast cereals.</p>",Vitamins
vitamin-d,Vitamin D,"<h3>About</h3><p>Although called a vitamin, vitamin D is actually a hormone which is activated by sunshine on your skin. Vitamin D is essential for bone strength as it helps your intestines absorb calcium. However, it is thought that vitamin D also plays an important role in immune function, as well as in many chronic diseases and mental health.</p>
<p>Many people in the UK have low levels of vitamin D with symptoms including muscle weakness, mood swings and fatigue. People who have dark skin, as well as those who don't spend much time outdoors are particularly at risk of low vitamin D. </p>
<p>Small amounts of vitamin D can be obtained from food, especially oily fish, eggs and any food which has been fortified with vitamin D. If you are deficient in vitamin D you are unlikely to be able to improve your levels by food alone.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>If you are found to have insufficient or deficient vitamin D then you are not alone; many people in the UK do not produce enough Vitamin D, especially in the winter months when there are fewer daylight hours. Low levels of vitamin D are almost always due to insufficient exposure to sunlight although lack of vitamin D rich foods may play a role.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Too much vitamin D is toxic and almost always caused by over-supplementation. Toxic levels can cause hyerpcalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia which can cause fatigue, constipation, back pain, forgetfulness, nausea, vomiting and in extreme cases even kidney or heart issues.  </p>
<p>If this is the case then supplementation should be immediately reduced. If supplements are not the cause then further investigation will be warranted.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>If your Vitamin D levels are low, implementing a few easy lifestyle changes such as getting out more in the sunshine, increasing the amount of oily fish you eat and taking a vitamin D supplement, can improve your vitamin D levels for the better.</p>

zinc-urine,Zinc - Urine,"<h3>About</h3><p>Zinc is necessary for immune function, wound healing, taste, smell and is essential for cell division and growth. Zinc also removes toxic metals such as copper, lead and mercury from the brain. Zinc is present in many tissues throughout the body but is not stored at any particular site. Therefore poor absorption can result in a zinc deficiency.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>The levels of zinc in the body decreases in response to infections so a low result does not necessarily indicate a zinc deficiency. As zinc is mainly bound to albumin when transported around the body, it can be useful to interpret zinc results alongside albumin results.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>High levels of zinc are rare as usually excess zinc is excreted in the urine and faeces.

iodine-urine,Iodine - Urine,"<h3>About</h3><p>Iodine is an essential trace element, important for healthy thyroid function, required to produce T3 and T4 thyroid hormones. Whether it is determining how fast your heart beats or how quickly your intestines process your food, thyroid hormones control the speed at which your body cells work. Without these hormones, the body would be unable to convert nutrients into energy.</p>
<p>Iodine is obtained through the diet and good sources include shellfish, dairy products and seaweed. Most people should be able to get all the iodine they need by eating a varied and balanced diet. The majority of iodine that is ingested is excreted via the urine. Measuring the amount of iodine excreted through the urine helps to determine iodine levels in the body.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of dietary iodine reduce the production of T3 and T4 thyroid hormones. An iodine deficiency in the body affects the functioning of the thyroid gland. An underactive thyroid gland does not produce enough of the hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Low thyroid hormone levels ultimately slow down the body’s metabolism. An iodine deficiency can also cause a thyroid swelling (a goitre).</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of iodine can cause you to develop a goitre, which is when a part of the thyroid gland become enlarged. Excessive levels can also upset your digestive tract, causing burning in the mouth, vomiting and abdominal pain.</p>",Minerals

Excess magnesium exposure can cause breathing problems, skin and eye irritation, flu-like symptoms and an upset stomach. Low magnesium can cause muscle aches and pains, fatigue, osteoporosis, an irregular heartbeat and high blood pressure. Low magnesium is associated with heart disease, artherosclerosis, stroke and diabetes.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A low magnesium level (hypomagnesemia) can be caused by poor nutrition, high alcohol consumption, diarrhoea and an inability to absorb nutrients in the gut. Symptoms of low magnesium can include twitching or spasms, especially in the muscles of the face, nausea and vomiting as well as fatigue.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>The kidneys remove any excess magnesium from the body so developing raised magnesium levels (hypermagnesemia) is rare. However, people with kidney problems and those supplementing with high amounts of magnesium may be at risk of developing hypermagnesemia.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>You should be able to improve levels of magnesium by incorporating more magnesium-rich foods into your diet.

<p>Zinc is transported around the body mainly bound to albumin, so it is useful to compare an abnormal zinc result with an albumin test result. While a low zinc concentration with a normal albumin can suggest zinc deficiency, a low zinc result with a low albumin concentration can suggest an infection and not necessarily zinc deficiency.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated zinc results are rare as any excess zinc in the body is usually excreted in the urine and faeces. Excessive supplementation of zinc can lead to raised levels which can be damaging to the kidneys. Symptoms of zinc toxicity include nausea, vomiting, lethargy and drowsiness.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>If your levels are too low, try to incorporate more zinc into your diet. Foods which are particularly rich in zinc include seafood, meat, dairy and eggs. Plant sources include pulses like chick peas, seeds, nuts and whole grains.

omega-6-omega-3,Omega 6 : Omega 3,"<h3>About</h3><p>Omega 6 and omega 3 are essential fatty acids in the body responsible for controlling inflammation, brain development and regulating blood pressure. Omega 6 is thought to have a pro-inflammatory role in the body while omega 3 is thought to have an anti-inflammatory role. The ideal ratio is thought to be around 2:1 although many people eating a Western diet, rich in processed foods and omega 6 processed vegetable oils have a ratio of over 10:1.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>A high ratio increases the risk of chronic inflammation in the body, which is thought to contribute to the development of certain diseases including heart disease.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>You can improve your ratio of omega 6/3 fatty acids through diet. For most people, getting an optimal ratio is not just about increasing consumption of omega 3 fatty acids, but  also, reducing the amount of omega 6 fatty acids they  consume. Replace oils which are high in omega 6 fatty acids (soy, sunflower and corn oils) with oils which have lower levels of omega 6, like olive oil or butter. You can increase your consumption of omega 3 fatty acids by eating oily fish, or by adding flaxseeds to your diet. You can consider taking omega 3 supplements, but be aware that recent studies have called into question their value in reducing the risk of heart attack or stroke.</p>",Omega fatty acids
uric-acid,Uric Acid,"<h3>About</h3><p>Uric acid is a waste product produced from the breakdown of chemical compounds called purines. Purine occurs naturally in the body, but it is also found in the food we eat - and in some foods more than others. In healthy individuals, uric acid is excreted by the kidneys in urine, however, if levels are too high to excrete, or if you have a problem metabolising purine, then uric acid can begin to accumulate and can be deposited as crystals in the bodily tissues. When this occurs in joints it causes the painful condition known as gout.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Slightly low levels of uric acid are not concerning and will not cause harm. Very low levels are rare, but can be caused by genetic disorders and lead to potential kidney issues.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of uric acid in the blood can cause gout, a painful type of arthritis which affects the joints, particularly those of your feet and hands. This is caused when the uric acid crystals begin to build up in the joints, for example in the big toe, causing it to become very hot, red, painful and swollen. Crystals can also build up in the kidney, causing kidney stones.</p><h3>How might I improve my result?</h3><p>Being overweight or obese is a risk factor for gout so it is important to reduce your weight to a healthy level. You may also be able to relieve or reduce attacks of gout by avoiding foods which are high in purines. These include organ meats (like liver and kidneys), red meat, and some fish (like anchovies, sardines and tuna) and shellfish. Reducing your alcohol intake, especially red wine, and keeping your body well hydrated can also help.</p>",Gout Risk

immunoglobulin-e,Immunoglobulin E,"<h3>About</h3><p>Immunoglobulins or antibodies, play an important role in the immune system and help fight against harmful bacteria and viruses in the body. There are five classes of antibodies and several subclasses. In those that have an allergy, their immune system overreacts to a harmless allergen (such as food, grass or animal dander) by producing IgE. This reaction usually causes irritation to the nose, lungs, throat and skin. </p>
<p>The allergen-specific IgE antibody test is used to check for an allergy to a specific allergen. It measures the amount of IgE antibody in the blood targeted for a suspected allergen.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated IgE results often indicate an allergy. However, not everyone with an elevated result will have a physical allergic reaction when exposed to that substance – the patient in this case is said to be 'sensitised' rather than allergic to the substance. </p>
<p>The level of IgE does not necessarily predict the severity of a reaction, although the higher the level the more likely you are to have a reaction to the allergen.</p>",Immunity
hepatitis-a-antibodies-igm,Hepatitis A Antibodies IgM,"<h3>About</h3><p>Hepatitis A is an acute, short-term disease caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). Hepatitis A is commonly transmitted by through food or water which has been contaminated by faeces from someone who is already infected by the virus. This type of hepatitis is most common in countries where the sanitation is poor. </p>

hepatitis-c-antibodies,Hepatitis C Antibodies,"<h3>About</h3><p>This test measures antibodies against hepatitis C in your blood which will tell you whether you have ever been infected with hepatitis C. Different laboratories will report results in different ways. If antibodies are reported as “detected”, “positive” or “reactive” then your result shows that you have been infected with hepatitis C. This test will not tell you whether your infection is still active so a positive test will need to be followed up with a test for a current infection. If your result is reported as “not detected”, “negative” or “non-reactive”, this means that you have not been infected by hepatitis C.  If you have not allowed enough time from your potential exposure to hepatitis C and your test, there may not have been sufficient time for antibodies to develop. This means that there is a risk that your test will return a “false negative”. If you believe that you are at risk of a hepatitis C infection you are advised to repeat the test again in 6 months.</p>
<p>Hepatitis C is a viral infection that can cause inflammation and scarring of the liver. If it is left untreated over many years, it can cause irreparable liver damage. About 20% of infected people clear the virus by themselves and, if treated, most people recover well from a hepatitis C infection. </p>
<p>Hepatitis C is normally transmitted by blood to blood contact. The most common cause of a hepatitis C infection is from shared needles, but it can also be transmitted from a mother to her unborn baby, and (less commonly) through unprotected sex. Health care workers or people who may come into contact with other people’s blood through their work may be required to check for hepatitis C. </p>

hepatitis-b-surface-antibodies,Hepatitis B Surface Antibodies,"<h3>About</h3><p>This test measures antibodies against hepatitis B in your blood. It will tell you whether you are immune to hepatitis B or whether you do not have immunity.
In most of the population, a result greater than 10 IU/L means that you have sufficient antibodies for immunity. A result less than 10 IU/L means that you are not immune.
If you are prone to exposure to hepatitis B through your work (Exposure Prone Procedures – EPP), then you will require a result greater than 100 IU/L to confirm immunity. </p>
<p>If your result shows that you have immunity to hepatitis B it means that you are both protected from possible infection and will not pass it on to another person. You can acquire hep B immunity through prior vaccination(s), or by having recovered from a previous infection.  This test will not tell you whether you are currently infected with hepatitis B. </p>
<p>Hepatitis B is an infectious viral disease which causes your liver to become inflamed and enlarged. Most people recover from an acute hepatitis B infection by themselves within around 6 months. However, for others, the infection becomes chronic (prolonged) which can lead to lasting liver damage. Hepatitis B can have few symptoms, especially in the early stages. </p>
<p>People who are at risk of becoming infected with hepatitis B are those who have had close contact with others who are infected (including unprotected sexual contact). Coming into contact with infected blood (e.g. through sharing needles, some contact sports) will also put you at risk of becoming infected with hepatitis B. Health care workers are often required to check their immunity against hep B for work purposes.</p>",Immunity

Some individuals will also experience swelling of the testicles and ovaries, and it can cause viral meningitis in a minority of cases. </p>
<p>Immunity to mumps can be acquired through vaccination or from having recovered from a previous infection. Immunity means that you will not catch mumps and neither can you spread mumps to another person. Health care workers may need to prove their mumps immunity to their employer.</p>",Immunity
measles-igg,Measles IgG,"<h3>About</h3><p>This test measures IgG antibodies to the measles virus which will tell you whether or not you are immune to measles. A result above a certain level will be reported as positive which means that you are immune to measles. Your result can also be reported as equivocal (which means that antibodies have been detected but they are not at a level where immunity is certain) or negative, which means that you are not immune to measles.</p>
<p>Measles is a contagious disease which is spread through coughing and sneezing. Measles causes symptoms such as a runny nose, cough and fever, red, light-sensitive eyes and small whitish spots on the inside of the cheeks. After a few days, a rash will develop. Measles often passes without incident, but in some cases serious complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis (swelling of the brain) can develop. </p>
<p>Immunity to measles is acquired through being vaccinated or as a result of having recovered from a previous infection. Once you are immune you are unlikely to catch measles again or pass measles onto another person. Health care workers may be required to prove immunity to measles by their employer.</p>",Immunity

measles-igm,Measles IgM,"<h3>About</h3><p>Measles is a viral infection which used to be common in childhood. The measles immunisation has been included in the UK childhood immunisation program since 1968 and it is now so rare that the World Health Organisation declared that measles had been eliminated in the UK in 2016. Symptoms develop 10-14 days after catching the virus, these include a blotchy red rash, fever, dry cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes and spots within the mouth. In most cases the infection is cleared by the immune system, but in a small number of cases the infection can be more serious, requiring hospitalisation. </p>
<p>This test measures Measles IgM antibodies which are part of the immune systems response to current measles infection.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>A positive result is found when someone is currently infected with the measles virus.</p>",Immunity
mumps-igm,Mumps IgM,"<h3>About</h3><p>Mumps caused by a virus from the Paramyxoviridae family, transmitted through air droplets or through direct contact with an infected person.

psa-total,PSA - Total,"<h3>About</h3><p>Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is a protein which is released into the blood by the prostate gland. Prostate cancer can raise PSA levels but a PSA test in isolation is not to be relied upon to diagnose prostate cancer, as levels can be raised in benign prostate disorders (a false positive). </p>
<p>There is also the potential for PSA levels to be normal despite the presence of prostate cancer, this is called a false negative.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Small amounts of PSA in the blood are completely normal.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>When used for screening in healthy men it is more common for an elevated PSA result to be due to an innocent cause than it is for there to be prostate cancer. Approximately 75% of such positive PSA results are 'false-positives' where the elevation has an innocent cause such as a urine infection or inflammation of the prostate.</p>",Prostate
blood-group,Blood Group,"<h3>About</h3><p>Red blood cells have various proteins on their surface called antigens. There are various types of red blood cell antigens - the ABO and rhesus types are the most important. Different combinations of these types give several different blood groups. There are four main blood groups: A, B, AB and O with each group being either RhD positive or RhD negative, resulting in a total of eight main blood groups. Your genetic make-up which you inherit from your parents determines which antigens occur on your red blood cells and therefore which blood group you are.</p>",Haematology

haematocrit,Haematocrit,"<h3>About</h3><p>HCT (haematocrit) measures the amount of space (volume) within the blood that is taken up by red blood cells.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of HCT (in combination with a low haemoglobin result) indicates that you may have anaemia. Anaemia has a wide variety of causes, including iron or vitamin B12 deficiency, chronic kidney disease, or bleeding from the digestive tract. </p>
<p>Anaemia can also arise when the body excessively destroys red blood cells, as found in conditions such as haemolytic anaemia.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of HCT indicate that you may have polycythaemia, meaning you have an excessively high number of red blood cells. This conclusion is normally arrived at in conjunction with a high haemoglobin result. Polycythaemia can arise when oxygen levels in the body drop, and the body tries to compensate by producing more red blood cells. This can happen in people with congenital heart defects and lung diseases such as COPD.</p>
<p>Raised levels of HCT can also be found in some smokers.</p>",Red Blood Cells
haemoglobin,Haemoglobin,"<h3>About</h3><p>Haemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells which carries oxygen around the body and gives the blood its red colour. This test measures the amount of haemoglobin in the blood and is a good measure of the blood's ability to carry oxygen around the body.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of haemoglobin indicate that you may have anaemia, which can have many causes including pregnancy, blood loss, liver damage, and iron deficiency. A low haemoglobin level should be investigated in line with other symptoms and results.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>High levels of haemoglobin can indicate polycythaemia, where the body increases red blood cell production. This is done in order to compensate for chronically low oxygen levels which could be caused by lung disease, or by living at altitude.  Other causes of high levels can include dehydration (this is a short term factor which resolves once you are fully hydrated) smoking, and bone marrow disorders.</p>",Red Blood Cells
mch,MCH,"<h3>About</h3><p>MCH (mean corpuscular haemoglobin) measures the average amount of haemoglobin contained in one of your red blood cells.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>MCH is looked at in the context of your other red cell blood markers. If your other markers are normal then a slightly low MCH level may not be significant.</p>
<p>Low MCH levels may be caused by anaemia, when the number of blood cells are low. Anaemia can be caused by iron deficiency, which can be caused by not consuming enough iron in the diet, or from conditions such as Crohn's disease where the intestines are unable to absorb sufficient iron. Other causes include gastrointestinal bleeds such as with peptic ulcers, and by a lack of vitamins such as B12 and folate.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>MCH is looked at in the context of your other red cell blood markers. If your other markers are normal then a slightly high MCH level may not be significant.</p>
<p>Elevated MCH levels may be a sign of macrocytic anaemia, where the red blood cells are too large and do not contain enough haemoglobin. This is most often caused by a lack of vitamin B12 and folate (either through diet or absorption problems) which can cause MCH levels to be either high or low, indicating the need of additional tests. </p>
<p>Elevated MCH levels can also be found in people with hyperthyroidism, liver disease and alcoholism.</p>",Red Blood Cells
mchc,MCHC,"<h3>About</h3><p>MCHC (mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration) is the average concentration of haemoglobin in your red blood cells. Haemoglobin is a molecule which allows red blood cells to transport oxygen around the body.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>MCHC is looked at in the context of your other red cell blood markers. If your other markers are normal then a slightly low MCHC level may not be significant.</p>
<p>Low levels of MCHC can be caused by anaemia, when the body is not producing sufficient haemoglobin. Anaemia can be caused by iron deficiency, which can be caused by not intaking enough iron in the diet, or from conditions such as Crohn's disease where the intestines are unable to absorb sufficient iron.</p>
<p>Anaemia can also be caused by chronic bleeds, such as peptic ulcers, and inherited disorders such as haemolytic anaemia.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>MCHC is looked at in the context of your other red cell blood markers. If your other markers are normal then a slightly high MCH level may not be significant.</p>
<p>Elevated levels of MCHC can indicate the presence of spherocytes (a type of red blood cell with too much haemoglobin) or a deficiency of folic acid or vitamin B12 in the diet.</p>",Red Blood Cells
mcv,MCV,"<h3>About</h3><p>MCV (mean corpuscular volume) reflects the average size of your red blood cells. This is important to measure, as it can indicate how much oxygen your cells are likely to be transporting around the body.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low MCV levels indicate that your red blood cells are a smaller size than they should be. This indicates that you may have microcytic anaemia, which is generally caused by iron deficiency anaemia. Low levels of iron in the blood reduce the amount of haemoglobin which can be made, thereby decreasing red blood cell size.</p>
<p>Iron deficiency anaemia may be caused by a reduced dietary intake of iron, or by malabsorptive conditions such as Crohn's disease, where the digestive tract is too inflamed to uptake enough iron.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated MCV levels indicate that your red blood cells are larger in size than they should be. This indicates a type of anaemia called macrocytic anaemia. This can be caused by a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, and is often seen in cases of excessive alcohol consumption associated with liver inflammation.</p>
<p>Elevated MCV levels may also be seen in some people with hypothyroidism.</p>",Red Blood Cells
rdw,RDW,"<h3>About</h3><p>Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) indicates whether your red blood cells are all the same size, or different sizes or shapes. Normally cells are fairly uniform both in size and in shape, but some blood disorders may cause your red blood cells to form in abnormal sizes. This test measures the difference between the largest and the smallest red blood cell.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>An elevated RDW can indicate that you have macrocytic anaemia, where your red blood cells are larger than they should be. This can be caused by not having enough vitamin B12 or folate in your diet, or by having a condition which prevents you from absorbing enough vitamins, such as Crohn's disease or pernicious anaemia.</p>
<p>An elevated RDW may also indicate that you have microcytic anaemia, where your red blood cells are smaller than they should be. This is generally caused by iron deficiency, which can be due to a lack of dietary iron, gastrointestinal bleeds and pregnancy.</p>",Red Blood Cells
red-cell-count,Red Cell Count,"<h3>About</h3><p>Red Blood Cell (RBC) Count analyses the number of red blood cells in the blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body, where it can be used to fuel energy processes such as movement and respiration. They also carry carbon dioxide produced from cells back to the lungs so that it can be exhaled.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A low RBC count can indicate that you have anaemia, meaning you have fewer RBCs than normal. Fewer red blood cells mean you have less capacity to transport oxygen around the body, resulting in less 'fuel' for essential energy processes. This is the major cause of fatigue that people with anaemia typically experience. </p>
<p>Anaemia has a wide variety of causes, including nutritional deficiencies such as lack of iron or folic acid, over-hydration as well as bleeding and bone marrow disorders.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>An elevated RBC count can indicate that you have polycythaemia, meaning that you have a greater number of RBCs than normal. This often arises as the body increases red blood cell production in order to compensate for chronically low oxygen levels caused by lung disease, or living at altitude. </p>
<p>Raised RBC counts can also be caused by dehydration, smoking, and kidney tumours which stimulate excess RBC production.</p>",Red Blood Cells

white-cell-count,White Cell Count,"<h3>About</h3><p>White Blood Cell (WBC) Count measures the number of white blood cells in the blood. White blood cells are key to your body's immune system. They fight infections and protect your body from foreign invaders such as harmful germs and bacteria. Additionally, they produce many antibodies and memory cells to protect you from further infections with the same germ.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A low WBC is normally a temporary finding and usually means that your body has been fighting an infection and your white cell count is depleted. Other causes can include vitamin deficiencies such as B12 or folate, liver diseases, and immune disorders such as HIV.</p>
<p>A low WBC count may also be induced by certain medication regimes, such as chemotherapy, which can prevent the bone marrow from producing sufficient white blood cells.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>An elevated white blood cell (WBC) count is a normal bodily response to infection and bodily damage, as the immune system sends many WBCs to the site to fight infections and clear dead cells. Consequently, WBC counts will be raised in people with bacterial infections or who have undergone trauma.</p>
<p>Raised WBC counts can also be caused by some blood disorders and by taking certain medications such as corticosteroids.</p>",White Blood Cells
basophils,Basophils,"<h3>About</h3><p>Basophils are a type of white blood cell that protect your body from bacteria and parasites such as ticks. They also play a role in allergic reactions.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of basophils can be caused allergic reactions and infections, when the levels of basophils have spiked in order to protect the body, and then been depleted afterwards.</p>
<p>Low levels of basophils are associated with hyperthyroidism.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of basophils can be seen with bone marrow disorders, in which the body produces an excess number of blood cells. Levels can also raise due to autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
<p>Raised levels of basophils are also associated with hypothyroidism.</p>",White Blood Cells
eosinophils,Eosinophils,"<h3>About</h3><p>Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that are responsible for removing parasitic infections and regulating inflammation to mark an infected site. They also play a role in allergy and in asthma.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of eosinophils can occur in response to infection, in particular in parasitic infections of the intestines, such as worms. Levels of this white blood cell rise in order to fight off the infection.</p>
<p>Elevated levels of eosinophils can also arise when the body induces greater inflammation than necessary, as is the case in asthma and allergic responses as well as in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.</p>",White Blood Cells
lymphocytes,Lymphocytes,"<h3>About</h3><p>Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell which fight bacterial and viral infections. They are the subset of white blood cells involved in the more specific response to infections, which can identify and differentiate between different foreign organisms that enter the body. As well as fighting infection, they produce antibodies and memory cells to help to prevent future infections from the same germ. Lymphocytes include T cells, B cells and natural killer cells.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of lymphocytes can arise after an infection such as a common cold, because many of them have been used up when fighting the infection. Stress and intense exercise can also cause levels to drop.</p>
<p>Low levels of lymphocytes can also be seen in people with certain diseases which can cause lymphocyte levels to drop.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of lymphocytes can arise for many reasons, but it is common for them to be raised after recent infection, particularly after the flu. Certain autoimmune conditions such as Grave's disease (an overactive thyroid) and lupus can also cause lymphocyte levels to spike.</p>",White Blood Cells
monocytes,Monocytes,"<h3>About</h3><p>Monocytes are a type of white blood cell that surround and destroy germs and dead or damaged cells from the blood. The heat and swelling that you feel when a body part is inflamed, for example after a cut on your finger, is caused by the activities of these cells.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of monocytes, also known as monocytopenia, can be caused by autoimmune disorders such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>Low levels of monocytes can also be caused by the use of medications which affect the bone marrow such as those used in chemotherapy, and by the use of immunosuppressive steroids such as prednisolone.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Elevated levels of monocytes, also known as monocytosis, can indicate chronic inflammation, one form of which is atherosclerosis, a cardiovascular disease where the blood vessels become hardened.</p>
<p>Elevated levels of monocytes can also be found in people with parasitic infections, very high stress levels, and in Cushing's disease, a condition in which the adrenal glands produce too much cortisol.</p>",White Blood Cells
neutrophils,Neutrophils,"<h3>About</h3><p>Neutrophils are the most abundant type of white blood cell in the body and are responsible for helping your body fight infection. When a germ is initially detected by the body, neutrophils are the defence system which go out and attack the germ before any of your other white blood cells. When neutrophils are low you can be more vulnerable to illness and infection.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A low level of neutrophils in the blood is called neutropenia, and is generally a temporary finding after an infection when your neutrophils can be depleted. Low neutrophils can also be caused by taking certain medications which may directly or indirectly lower neutrophil levels. Examples of these medications include chemotherapies, immunosuppressants and some antibiotics.</p>
<p>Low levels of neutrophils can also be found with conditions which suppress the bone marrow, such as aplastic anaemia, and in conditions such as AIDS, in which the HIV virus attacks the immune system.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>An elevated level of neutrophils in the blood is called neutrophilia, and generally indicates that you have a infection. When under attack from bacteria or a virus your immune system produces more neutrophils to send out into the blood to destroy the invader.</p>
<p>Elevated levels of neutrophils can also be found in people who exercise intensively, who have high stress levels or who take steroid medication such as prednisolone or cortisone.</p>",White Blood Cells
mpv,MPV,"<h3>About</h3><p>MPV, or Mean Platelet Volume, is a measurement of the average size of your platelets. Platelets are fragmented cells within the blood that aid the process of clot formation. MPV provides an indication of platelet production in your bone marrow.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Low levels of MPV indicate that your platelets are small, or that a reduced number of platelets are being produced. This may indicate a bone marrow disorder, including the effects of chemotherapy on the bone marrow.</p>
<p>Low levels of MPV may also be found in people with inflammatory bowel disease and aplastic anaemia, however other blood biomarkers would need to be assessed in order to arrive at these diagnoses.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Raised levels of MPV can be found when increased numbers of platelets are being produced. This is because newer platelets are larger than older ones, and so the presence of recently produced platelets increases the MPV value. Elevated levels for MPV can also be found in people with a range of conditions including hyperthyroidism, hypertension, and diabetes.</p>",Clotting Status
platelet-count,Platelet Count,"<h3>About</h3><p>Platelets or clotting cells are the smallest type of blood cell. They are formed in the bone marrow and are important in blood clotting. When bleeding occurs, the platelets swell, clump together and form a sticky plug (a clot) which helps stop the bleeding.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>A low platelet count is called thrombocytopenia and can be mild or severe. Low platelets may make you prone to bruising or uncontrolled bleeding. Low platelets can be caused by the bone marrow producing too few platelets, or by the body destroying them faster than they can be produced e.g. in an autoimmune condition. Low platelets can also be caused by certain medications, by nutritional deficiencies such as iron, vitamin B12 and folate, some viral infections as well as alcoholism and liver disease. Pregnancy can also cause platelets to be mildly low.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>A high platelet count is called thrombocythemia or thrombocytosis and occurs when the bone marrow produces too many platelets. Raised platelets can be caused by a bone marrow disorder, or can be the result of infection, inflammation, iron deficiency anaemia, recent trauma or blood loss.</p>",Clotting Status
aptt,APTT,"<h3>About</h3><p>APTT, or Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time measures the speed at which blood clots in the body are formed, through a route known as the intrinsic pathway.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Decreased aPTT may be seen temporarily during the body's response to acute trauma or inflammation.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>Prolonged aPTT means that blood clots in the body take longer to form. Conditions with higher values for aPTT include clotting factor deficiencies, antiphospholipid syndrome and haemophilia.</p>
<p>Medications such as heparin can also increase aPTT.</p>",Clotting Status
pt,PT,"<h3>About</h3><p>Prothrombin is a plasma protein produced by the liver. A prothrombin time test measures how long it takes for the blood to clot. Clotting is caused by a series of clotting factors activating each other, including the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>An increased prothrombin time indicates your blood is taking longer to form a clot. If you are not taking anticoagulant drugs and your prothrombin time is prolonged, additional testing may be necessary to determine the cause.</p>",Clotting Status

drvvt-ratio,DRVVT Ratio,"<h3>About</h3><p>Venom from the Russell's Viper snake causes blood to clot more quickly, whilst antiphospholipid syndrome slows down the speed at which blood clots. This test compares the time taken for a patient's blood sample to clot when it is mixed with Russell's Viper venom, and compares it to the speed for a control blood sample to clot.  By dividing the time taken for the patient's sample to clot by the time taken for the control sample to clot a ratio is created, this helps to correct for the variability that can happen in reference ranges across laboratories. People who have antiphospholipid syndrome will clot more slowly, so the DRVVT ratio will be increased.</p><h3>What might a high result mean?</h3><p>An elevated DRVVT ratio may be an indication that antiphospholipid syndrome is present. The likelihood of this is increased if there are also beta 2 glycoprotein antibodies, and anti-cardiolipin antibodies.</p>",Clotting Status
drvvt-patient,DRVVT - Patient,"<h3>About</h3><p>Venom from the Russell's Viper snake causes blood to clot more quickly, whilst antiphospholipid syndrome slows down the speed at which blood clots. This test compares the time taken for a patient's blood sample to clot when it is mixed with Russell's Viper venom, and compares it to the speed for a control blood sample to clot.  By dividing the time taken for the patient's sample to clot by the time taken for the control sample to clot a ratio is created, this helps to correct for the variability that can happen in reference ranges across laboratories. People who have antiphospholipid syndrome will clot more slowly, so the DRVVT ratio will be increased.</p>

protein-c-activity,Protein C Activity,"<h3>About</h3><p>Protein C is a natural anticoagulant in the blood which works to cleave certain clotting factors to stop the blood clotting process. However, some people are deficient in protein C, leading to abnormal clot formation which can increase the risk of venous thromboses such as DVT.</p><h3>What might a low result mean?</h3><p>Whilst a deficiency in Protein C can be genetic, low levels can also be caused by liver and kidney problems or a vitamin K deficiency – which can occur in those taking warfarin.</p>",Clotting Status
